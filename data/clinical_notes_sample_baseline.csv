0, A 23-year-old white female presents with complaint of allergies., Allergy / Immunology, Allergic Rhinitis ,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This 23-year-old white female presents with complaint of allergies.  She used to have allergies when she lived in Seattle but she thinks they are worse here.  In the past, she has tried Claritin, and Zyrtec.  Both worked for short time but then seemed to lose effectiveness.  She has used Allegra also.  She used that last summer and she began using it again two weeks ago.  It does not appear to be working very well.  She has used over-the-counter sprays but no prescription nasal sprays.  She does have asthma but doest not require daily medication for this and does not think it is flaring up.,MEDICATIONS: , Her only medication currently is Ortho Tri-Cyclen and the Allegra.,ALLERGIES: , She has no known medicine allergies.,OBJECTIVE:,Vitals:  Weight was 130 pounds and blood pressure 124/78.,HEENT:  Her throat was mildly erythematous without exudate.  Nasal mucosa was erythematous and swollen.  Only clear drainage was seen.  TMs were clear.,Neck:  Supple without adenopathy.,Lungs:  Clear.,ASSESSMENT:,  Allergic rhinitis.,PLAN:,1.  She will try Zyrtec instead of Allegra again.  Another option will be to use loratadine.  She does not think she has prescription coverage so that might be cheaper.,2.  Samples of Nasonex two sprays in each nostril given for three weeks.  A prescription was written as well.","allergy / immunology, allergic rhinitis, allergies, asthma, nasal sprays, rhinitis, nasal, erythematous, allegra, sprays, allergic,","{'Name': 'Patient', 'Age': '23', 'Gender': 'Female', 'Symptoms': ['Allergies', 'Allergic rhinitis', 'Erythematous throat', 'Swollen nasal mucosa', 'Clear nasal drainage'], 'Diagnoses': ['Allergic rhinitis', 'Asthma'], 'Medications': ['Ortho Tri-Cyclen', 'Allegra', 'Claritin (past)', 'Zyrtec (past)', 'Nasonex (sample given)'], 'Tests': ['Vitals (Weight, Blood Pressure)', 'HEENT exam', 'Neck exam', 'Lungs exam']}"

She has tried many different diets, but is unsuccessful. ", Bariatrics, Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass ,"PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: , Morbid obesity.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  ,Morbid obesity.,PROCEDURE: , Laparoscopic antecolic antegastric Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with EEA anastomosis.,ANESTHESIA: , General with endotracheal intubation.,INDICATION FOR PROCEDURE: , This is a 30-year-old female, who has been overweight for many years.  She has tried many different diets, but is unsuccessful.  She has been to our Bariatric Surgery Seminar, received some handouts, and signed the consent.  The risks and benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  All pressure points were carefully padded.  She was given general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.  SCD stockings were placed on both legs.  Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression.  The abdomen was then prepped and draped in standard sterile surgical fashion.  Marcaine was then injected through umbilicus.  A small incision was made.  A Veress needle was introduced into the abdomen.  CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg.  A 12-mm VersaStep port was placed through the umbilicus.  I then placed a 5-mm port just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal on the right side.  I placed another 5-mm port in the midclavicular line just subcostal on the right side, a few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 12-mm VersaStep port.  On the left side, just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal, I placed a 5-mm port.  A few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 15-mm port.  I began by lifting up the omentum and identifying the transverse colon and lifting that up and thereby identifying my ligament of Treitz.  I ran the small bowel down approximately 40 cm and divided the small bowel with a white load GIA stapler.  I then divided the mesentery all the way down to the base of the mesentery with a LigaSure device.  I then ran the distal bowel down, approximately 100 cm, and at 100 cm, I made a hole at the antimesenteric portion of the Roux limb and a hole in the antimesenteric portion of the duodenogastric limb, and I passed a 45 white load stapler and fired a stapler creating a side-to-side anastomosis.  I reapproximated the edges of the defect.  I lifted it up and stapled across it with another white load stapler.  I then closed the mesenteric defect with interrupted Surgidac sutures.  I divided the omentum all the way down to the colon in order to create a passageway for my small bowel to go antecolic.  I then put the patient in reverse Trendelenburg.  I placed a liver retractor, identified, and dissected the angle of His.  I then dissected on the lesser curve, approximately 2.5 cm below the gastroesophageal junction, and got into a lesser space.  I fired transversely across the stomach with a 45 blue load stapler.  I then used two fires of the 60 blue load with SeamGuard to go up into my angle of His, thereby creating my gastric pouch.  I then made a hole at the base of the gastric pouch and had Anesthesia remove the bougie and place the OG tube connected to the anvil.  I pulled the anvil into place, and I then opened up my 15-mm port site and passed my EEA stapler.  I passed that in the end of my Roux limb and had the spike come out antimesenteric.  I joined the spike with the anvil and fired a stapler creating an end-to-side anastomosis, then divided across the redundant portion of my Roux limb with a white load GI stapler, and removed it with an Endocatch bag.  I put some additional 2-0 Vicryl sutures in the anastomosis for further security.  I then placed a bowel clamp across the bowel.  I went above and passed an EGD scope into the mouth down to the esophagus and into the gastric pouch.  I distended gastric pouch with air.  There was no air leak seen.  I could pass the scope easily through the anastomosis.  There was no bleeding seen through the scope.  We closed the 15-mm port site with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture utilizing Carter-Thomason.  I copiously irrigated out that incision with about 2 L of saline.  I then closed the skin of all incisions with running Monocryl.  Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.","bariatrics, gastric bypass, eea anastomosis, roux-en-y, antegastric, antecolic, morbid obesity, roux limb, gastric pouch, intubation, laparoscopic, bypass, roux, endotracheal, anastomosis, gastric","{'Name': None, 'Age': '30', 'Gender': 'female', 'Symptoms': ['Overweight for many years', 'Unsuccessful with diets'], 'Diagnoses': ['Morbid obesity'], 'Medications': ['Marcaine'], 'Tests': ['EGD scope']}"

Lipodystrophy of the abdomen.,PROCEDURES:,1.  Revision, right breast reconstruction.,2.  Excision, soft tissue fullness of the lateral abdomen and flank.,3.  Liposuction of the supraumbilical abdomen.,ANESTHESIA: , General.,INDICATION FOR OPERATION:,  The patient is a 31-year-old white female who previously has undergone latissimus dorsi flap and implant, breast reconstruction.  She now had lateralization of the implant with loss of medial fullness for which she desired correction.  It was felt that mobilization of the implant medially would provide the patient significant improvement and this was discussed with the patient at length.  The patient also had a small dog ear in the flank area on the right from the latissimus flap harvest, which was to be corrected.  She had also had liposuction of the periumbilical and infraumbilical abdomen with desire to have great improvement superiorly, was felt to be a candidate for such.  The above-noted procedure was discussed with the patient in detail.  The risks, benefits and potential complications were discussed.  She was marked in the upright position and then taken to the operating room for the above-noted procedure.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position.  Following adequate induction of general LMA anesthesia, the chest and abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  The supraumbilical abdomen was then injected with a solution of 5% lidocaine with epinephrine, as was the dog ear.  At this time, the superior central scar was then excised, dissection continued through the subcutaneous tissue, the underlying latissimus muscle until the capsule of the implant was reached.  This was then opened.  The implant was removed and placed on the back table in antibiotic solution.  Using Bovie cautery, the medial capsule was released and undermining was then performed with release of the muscle to the level of the proposed medial projection of the breast.  The inframammary fold medially was secured with 2-0 PDS suture to create greater takeoff point at this level which in the upright position and using a sizer produced a good form.  The lateral pocket was diminished by series of 2-0 PDS suture to provide medialization of the implant.  The implant was then placed back into the submuscular pocket with much improved positioning and medial fullness.  With this completed, the implant was again removed, antibiotic irrigation was performed.  A drain was placed and brought out through a separate inferior stab wound incision and hemostasis was confirmed.  The implant was then replaced and the wound was then closed in layers using 2-0 PDS running suture on the muscle and 3-0 Monocryl Dermabond subcuticular sutures.  The 2.5 cm dog ear was then excised into and including the subcutaneous tissue, even contouring was achieved and this was closed with two layers using 3-0 Monocryl suture.  Using a #3 cannula, a superior umbilical incision, liposuction was carried out into the supraumbilical abdomen, removing approximately 40 to 50 mL of fat with improved supraumbilical contours.  This was closed with 6-0 Prolene suture.  The patient was placed in a compressive garment after treating the incision with Dermabond, Steri-Strips and antibiotic ointment around the drain site and umbilicus.  A Kerlix dressing and a surgical bra was placed to the chest area.  A compressive garment was placed.  The patient was then aroused from anesthesia, extubated, and taken to the recovery room in stable condition.  Sponge, needle, lap, instrument counts were all correct.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  There were no complications.  The estimated blood loss was approximately 25 mL.","bariatrics, breast reconstruction, excess, lma anesthesia, lipodystrophy, liposuction, abdomen, drain site, flank, latissimus dorsi flap, soft tissue, supraumbilical, surgical bra, supraumbilical abdomen, reconstruction, breast, tissue, implant,","{'Name': 'Patient', 'Age': '31', 'Gender': 'Female', 'Symptoms': ['Lateralization of breast implant with loss of medial fullness', 'Small dog ear in the flank area on the right', 'Desire for improvement in supraumbilical abdomen contour after previous liposuction'], 'Diagnoses': ['Deformity, right breast reconstruction', 'Excess soft tissue, anterior abdomen and flank', 'Lipodystrophy of the abdomen'], 'Medications': ['5% lidocaine with epinephrine', 'Antibiotic solution', 'Antibiotic ointment'], 'Tests': []}"

However developed progressive problems and he had two additional stents placed with some initial improvement.  Subsequently, he developed progressive airway obstruction and came into the ABC Hospital critical airway service for further evaluation and was admitted on Month DD, YYYY.  He underwent bronchoscopy by Dr. W and found to have an extensive subglottic upper tracheal and distal tracheal stenosis secondary to metallic stent extensive granulation and inflammatory tissue changes.  The patient had some debridement and then was hospitalized and Laryngology and Thoracic Surgery services were consulted for further management.  Exploration of trachea, removal of foreign body stents constricting his airway, dilation and stabilization of his trachea were offered to the patient.  Nature of the proposed procedure including risks and complications of bleeding, infection, alteration of voice, speech, swallowing, voice changes permanently, possibility of tracheotomy temporarily or permanently to maintain his airway, loss of voice, cardiac risk factors, anesthetic risks, recurrence of problems, upon surgical intervention were all discussed at length.  The patient stated that he understood and wished to proceed.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE,The patient was taken to the operating room, placed in the supine position.  Following adequate monitoring by Anesthesia Service to maintain sedation, the patient's neck was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion.  The neck was then infiltrated with 1% Xylocaine and 1000 epinephrine.  A collar incision approximately 1 fingerbreadth above the clavicle, this was an outline incision, was carried out.  The skin, subcutaneous tissue, platysma, subplatysmal flaps elevated superiorly and inferiorly.  Strap muscles were separated in the midline, dissection carried down to visceral fascia.  Beneath the strap muscles, there was dense inflammation scarring obscuring palpable landmarks.  There appeared to be significant scarring fusion of soft tissue at the perichondrium and cartilage of the cricoid making the cricoid easily definable.  There was a markedly enlarged thyroid isthmus.  Thyroid isthmus was divided and dense inflammation, attachment of the thyroid isthmus, fusion of the thyroid gland to the capsule to the pretracheal fascia requiring extensive blunt sharp dissection.  Trachea was exposed from the cricoid to the fourth ring which entered down into the chest.  The trachea was incised between the second and third ring inferior limb in the midline and excision of small ridge of cartilage on each side sent for pathologic evaluation.  The tracheal cartilage externally had marked thickening and significant stiffness calcification, and the tracheal wall from the outside of the trachea to the mucosa measured 3 to 4 mm in thickness.  The trachea was entered and visualized with thickening of the mucosa and submucosa was noted.  The patient, however, was able to ventilate at this point a #6 Endo Tube was inserted and general anesthesia administered.  Once the airway was secured, we then proceeded working around the #6 Endo Tube as well as with the tube intake and out to explore the trachea with ridged fiberoptic scopes as well as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy to the trach site.  Examination revealed extrusion of metallic fragments from stent and multiple metallic fragments were removed from the stent in the upper trachea.  A careful examination of the subglottic area showed inflamed and thickened mucosa but patent subglottis.  After removal of the stents and granulation tissue, the upper trachea was widely patent.  The mid trachea had some marked narrowing secondary to granulation.  Stent material was removed from this area as well.  In the distal third of the trachea, a third stent was embedded within the mucosa, not encroaching on the lumen without significant obstruction distally and this was not disturbed at this time.  All visible stent material in the upper and mid trachea were removed.  Initial attempt to place a #16 Montgomery T tube showed the distal lumen of the T tube to be too short to stent the granulation narrowing of the trachea at the junction of the anterior two thirds and the distal third.  Also, this was removed and a #8 Shiley single cannula tracheostomy tube was placed after removal of the endotracheal tube.  A good ventilation was confirmed and the position of the tube confirmed it to be at the level just above the metallic stent which was embedded in the mucosa.  The distal trachea and mainstem bronchi were widely patent.  This secured his airway and no further manipulation felt to be needed at this time.  Neck wound was thoroughly irrigated and strap muscles were closed with interrupted 3-0 Vicryl.  The skin laterally to the trach site was closed with running 2-0 Prolene.  Tracheostomy tube was secured with interrupted 2-0 silk sutures and the patient was taken back to the Intensive Care Unit in satisfactory condition.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without complication.","cardiovascular / pulmonary, airway, laryngology, shiley, alteration of voice, bronchi, bronchoscopy, cannula, cartilage, cricoid, flexible, foreign body, mainstem, obstruction, perichondrium, stenosis, stent, subglottic, swallowing, trachea, tracheal, tracheal stenosis, tracheostomy, shiley single cannula tracheostomy, shiley single cannula, single cannula tracheostomy, thyroid isthmus, stent material, tracheostomy tube, tube, thyroid, ","{'Name': 'Unknown', 'Age': '50', 'Gender': 'Male', 'Symptoms': ['Progressive airway obstruction', 'Subglottic upper tracheal and distal tracheal stenosis', 'Metallic stent extensive granulation and inflammatory tissue changes', 'Extrusion of metallic fragments from stent', 'Inflamed and thickened mucosa', 'Marked narrowing secondary to granulation'], 'Diagnoses': ['Airway obstruction secondary to severe subglottic tracheal stenosis', 'Tracheomalacia', 'Foreign body in the trachea', 'Metallic stent in trachea'], 'Medications': ['Xylocaine', 'Epinephrine'], 'Tests': ['Bronchoscopy', 'Flexible bronchoscopy', 'Rigid fiberoptic scopes', 'Pathologic evaluation']}"

He has remained azoospermic postoperatively.  The operative note suggests the presence of some sperm and sperm head on the right side at the time of the vasectomy reversal.,He states that he is interested in sperm harvesting and cryopreservation prior to the next attempted ovulation induction for his wife.  Apparently, several attempts at induction have been tried and due to some anatomic abnormality, they have been unsuccessful.,At the time that he left the office, he was asking for cryopreservation.  At the time of sperm harvesting, I recently received a phone call suggesting that he does not want to do this at all unless his wife's ovulation has been confirmed and it appears then that he may be interested in a fresh specimen harvest.  I look forward to hearing from you regarding the actual plan so that we can arrange our procedure appropriately.

He was unable to walk and would not stand upright, and had fairly significant discomfort, so the parents checked his panel because of it.  Because of this, they took him to Emergency Department, at which time, he had no swelling noted initially, but very painful.  He had no voiding or stooling problems.  No nausea, vomiting or fever.  Family denies trauma or dysuria.  At that time, he was going to get an ultrasound done, but the mother said that all of sudden the patient stated the pain had resolved.  He has had hot chocolate this morning at 10:30 in the morning and water around 2:30 in the morning.  He has not had any pain since but states that he has had pain in the past, not as long and states there was a twisting sensation.  He has no recent cold or flu, although he had rhinorrhea about 3 weeks ago.  He is on no medications and he is here for evaluation.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:,  The patient has no known allergies.  He is term delivery via spontaneous vaginal delivery.  He has had no problems or hospitalizations with circumcision.,PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: , He has had no previous surgeries.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  All 14-point review of systems were negative except for the above left testicular pain and the history of possible upper respiratory infection about 2 to 3 weeks ago.,IMMUNIZATIONS: , Up-to-date.,FAMILY HISTORY: , The patient lives at home with both parents who are Spanish speaking.  He is not in school.,MEDICATIONS:,  He is on no medications.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  On physical exam, weight is 15.9 kg.,GENERAL:  The patient is a cooperative little boy.,HEENT:  Normal head and neck exam.  No oral or nasal discharge.,NECK:  Without masses.,CHEST:  Without masses.,LUNGS:  Clear.,CARDIAC:  Without murmurs or gallops.,ABDOMEN:  Soft.  No masses or tenderness.  His scrotum did not have any swelling at the present time.  There was only minimal discomfort with palpation at the left inguinal area, but no masses were noted.  No palpable nodules such as appendix testis and no swelling was noted and he had mild epididymal swelling only.  His left testis was slightly harder than the right, but this was not very significant.,EXTREMITIES:  He had full range of motion in all 4 extremities.,SKIN:  Warm, pink, and dry.,NEUROLOGIC:  Grossly intact.,LABORATORY DATA: , Ultrasound was obtained today showing no blood flow or poor blood flow on the left except for increased blood flow to the epididymis on the study done at about 1330 hours, and second one done around 1630 hours was normal flow, possible increased flow on the left.  This is personally reviewed by me.  The right was normal.  No masses were appreciated.  There was some mild change in echotexture on the left on the initial study, which had apparently resolved on the second, but may be due to the technical aspects of the study.,ASSESSMENT/PLAN: , The patient has a possibly torsion detorsion versus other acute testicular problem.  If the patient has indeed testicular torsion, there is an increased possibility that it may reoccur again, actually within the first 24 to 36 hours and as such is recommended doing a left scrotal exploration with possible detorsion of left testis, possible orchiectomy if the testis is markedly abnormal or nonviable, which probably is not the case, and bilateral testes fixation if the torsion is found.  I discussed the pre and postsurgical care with the parents.  Procedure itself with potential complications, risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgery including that the torsion could occur again, although it is less likely after the surgical fixation procedure.  The parents understand and wished to proceed.

He was found to have a new tumor last fall, and cystoscopy in November showed Ta papillary-appearing lesion inside the bladder neck anteriorly.  The patient had coronary artery disease and required revascularization, which occurred at the end of December prior to the tumor resection.  He is fully recovered and cleared by Cardiology and taken to the operating room at this time for TURBT.,FINDINGS: , Cystoscopy of the anterior and posterior urethra was within normal limits.  From 12 o'clock to 4 o'clock inside the bladder neck, there was a papillary tumor with some associated blood clot.  This was completely resected.  There was an abnormal dysplastic area in the left lateral wall that was biopsied, and the remainder of the bladder mucosa appeared normal.  The ureteral orifices were in the orthotopic location.  Prostate was 15 g and benign on rectal examination, and there was no induration of the bladder.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the cystoscopy suite, and after adequate general laryngeal mask anesthesia obtained, placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and his perineum and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in usual fashion.  He had been given oral ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis.  Rectal bimanual examination was performed with the findings described.  Cystourethroscopy was performed with a #23-French ACMI panendoscope and 70-degree lens with the findings described.  A barbotage urine was obtained for cytology.  The cystoscope was removed and a #24-French continuous flow resectoscope sheath was introduced over visual obturator and cold cup biopsy forceps introduced.  Several biopsies were taken from the tumor and sent to the tumor bank.  I then introduced the Iglesias resectoscope element and resected all the exophytic tumor and the lamina propria.  Because of the Ta appearance, I did not intentionally dissect deeper into the muscle.  Complete hemostasis was obtained.  All the chips were removed with an Ellik evacuator.  Using the cold cup biopsy forceps, biopsy was taken from the dysplastic area in the left bladder and hemostasis achieved.  The irrigant was clear.  At the conclusion of the procedure, the resectoscope was removed and a #24-French Foley catheter was placed for efflux of clear irrigant.

The patient also has family status complete and desired infertility.  The patient was scheduled for elective left spermatocelectomy and bilateral partial vasectomy.,FINDINGS: , At this time of the surgery, significant left-sided spermatocele was noted encompassing almost the entirety of the left epididymis with only minimal amount of normal appearing epididymis remaining.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent was obtained, the patient was moved to the operating room.  A general anesthesia was induced by the Department of Anesthesia.,The patient was prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion for a scrotal approach.  A #15 blade was used to make a transverse incision on the left hemiscrotum.  Electrocautery was used to carry the incision down into the tunica vaginalis and the testicle was delivered into the field.  The left testicle was examined.  A large spermatocele was noted.  Metzenbaum scissors were used to dissect the tissue around the left spermatocele.  Once the spermatocele was identified, as stated above, significant size was noted encompassing the entire left epididymis.  Metzenbaum scissors as well as electrocautery was used to dissect free the spermatocele from its testicular attachments and spermatocelectomy and left epididymectomy was completed with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used to confirm excellent hemostasis.  Attention was then turned to the more proximal aspect of the cord.  The vas deferens was palpated and dissected free with Metzenbaum scissors.  Hemostats were placed on the two aspects of the cord, approximately 1 cm segment of cord was removed with Metzenbaum scissors and electrocautery was used to cauterize the lumen of the both ends of vas deferens and silk ties used to ligate the cut ends.  Testicle was placed back in the scrotum in appropriate anatomic position.  The dartos tissue was closed with running #3-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed in a horizontal interrupted mattress fashion with #4-0 chromic.  Attention was then turned to the right side.  The vas was palpated in the scrotum.  A small skin incision was made with a #15 blade and the vas was grasped with a small Allis clamp and brought into the surgical field.  A scalpel was used to excise the vas sheath and vas was freed from its attachments and grasped again with a hemostat.  Two ends were hemostated with hemostats and divided with Metzenbaum scissors.  Lumen was coagulated with electrocautery.  Silk ties used to ligate both cut ends of the vas deferens and placed back into the scrotum.  A #4-0 chromic suture was used in simple fashion to reapproximate the skin incision.  Scrotum was cleaned and bacitracin ointment, sterile dressing, fluffs, and supportive briefs applied.

He was initially dry without pads and then underwent salvage radiation therapy for rising PSA.  After that he began with episodes of incontinence as well as urinary retention requiring catheterization.  One year ago, he was unable to catheterize and was taken to the operative room and had cystoscopy.  He had retained staple removed and a diverticulum identified.  There were also bladder stones that were lasered and removed, and he had been incontinent ever since that time.  He wears 8 to 10 pads per day, and this has affected his quality of life significantly.  I took him to the operating room on January 16, 2008, and found diffuse radiation changes with a small capacity bladder and wide-open bladder neck.  We both felt that his lower urinary tract was not rehabilitatable and that a continent cutaneous diversion would solve the number of problems facing him.  I felt like if we could remove the bladder safely, then this would also provide a benefit.,FINDINGS: , At exploration, there were no gross lesions of the smaller or large bowel.  The bladder was predictably sucked into the pelvic sidewall both inferiorly and laterally.  The opened bladder, which we were able to remove completely, had a wide-open capacious diverticulum in its very distal segment.  Because of the previous radiation therapy and a dissection down to the pelvis, I elected to place an omental pedicle flap to provide additional blood supply for healing as well in the pelvis and also under the pubic bone which was exposed inferiorly due to previous surgery and treatment.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was brought to the operative suite and after adequate general endotracheal and epidural anesthesia obtained, placed in the supine position, flexed over the anterosuperior iliac spine, and his abdomen and genitalia were sterilely prepped and draped in the usual fashion.  A nasogastric tube was placed as well as radial arterial line.  He was given intravenous antibiotics for prophylaxis.  A generous midline skin incision was made from the midepigastrium down to the symphysis pubis, deep into the rectus fascia, the rectus muscle separated in the midline, and exploration carried out with the findings described.  Moist wound towels and a Bookwalter retractor were placed for exposure.  We began by retracting the bowels by mobilizing the cecum and ascending colon and hepatic flexure and elevating the terminal ileum up to the second and third portion of the duodenum.  The ureter was identified as a crisis over the iliac vessels and dissected deep into pelvis and subsequently divided between clips.  An identical procedure was performed in the left side with similar findings and the bowels were packed cephalad.,We began then dissecting the bladder away from the pelvic side walls staying medial to both epigastric arteries.  This was quite challenging because of the previous radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy.  We essentially carved the bladder off of the pelvic sidewall inferiorly as best we could and then we were able to have enough freedom to identify the lateral pedicles, and these were taken between double clips approximately and clipped distally.  We then approached things posteriorly and carefully dissected between the __________ and posterior bladder.  There was some remnant seminal vesicle on the right as well as both remnant ejaculatory duct and we used this to dissect the longus safe plane anterior to the rectum.  We then entered the bladder anteriorly as distal as we could and remove the bladder and what we thought was a bladder neck and this appeared to end in a diverticulum.  We then peeled it off the remaining rectum and passed the specimen off the operative field.  Bladder was irrigated with warm sterile water and a meticulous inspection was made for hemostasis.,We then completely mobilized the omentum off of the proximal transverse colon.  This allowed a generous flap to be able to be laid into the pelvis without tension.,We then turned our attention to forming the Indiana pouch.  I completed the dissection of the right hepatic flexure and the proximal transverse colon and mobilized the omentum off of this portion of the colon.  The colon was divided proximal to the middle colic using a GIA-80 stapler.  I then divided the avascular plane of Treves along the terminal ileum and selected a point approximately 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve to divide the ileum.  The mesentery was then sealed with a LigaSure device and divided, and the bowel was divided with a GIA-60 stapler.  We then performed a side-to-side ileo-transverse colostomy using a GIA-80 stapler, closing the open end with a TA 60.  The angles were reinforced with silk sutures and the mesenteric closed with interrupted silk sutures.,We then removed the staple line along the terminal ileum, passed a 12-French Robinson catheter into the cecal segment, and plicated the ileum with 3 firings of the GIA-60 stapler.  The ileocecal valve was then reinforced with interrupted 3-0 silk sutures as described by Rowland, et al, and following this, passage of an 18-French Robinson catheter was associated with the characteristic ""pop,"" indicating that we had adequately plicated the ileocecal valve.,As the patient had had a previous appendectomy, we made an opening in the cecum in the area of the previous appendectomy.  We then removed the distal staple line along the transverse colon and aligned the cecal end and the distal middle colic end with two 3-0 Vicryl sutures.  The bowel segment was then folded over on itself and the reservoir formed with 3 successive applications of the SGIA Polysorb-75.  Between the staple lines, Vicryl sutures were placed and the defects closed with 3-0 Vicryl suture ligatures.,We then turned our attention to forming the ileocolonic anastomosis.  The left ureter was mobilized and brought underneath the sigmoid mesentery and brought through the mesentery of the terminal ileum and an end-to-side anastomosis performed with an open technique using interrupted 4-0 Vicryl sutures, and this was stented with a Cook 8.4-French ureteral stent, and this was secured to the bowel lumen with a 5-0 chromic suture.  The right ureter was brought underneath the pouch and placed in a stented fashion with an identical anastomosis.  We then brought the stents out through a separate incision cephalad in the pouch and they were secured with a 2-0 chromic suture.  A 24-French Malecot catheter was placed through the cecum and secured with a chromic suture.  The staple lines were then buried with a running 3-0 Vicryl two-layer suture and the open end of the pouch closed with a TA 60 Polysorb suture.  The pouch was filled to 240 cc and noted to be watertight, and the ureteral anastomoses were intact.,We then made a final inspection for hemostasis.  The cecostomy tube was then brought out to the right lower quadrant and secured to the skin with silk sutures.  We then matured our stoma through the umbilicus.  We removed the plug of skin through the umbilicus and delivered the ileal segment through this.  A portion of the ileum was removed and healthy, well-vascularized tissue was matured with interrupted 3-0 chromic sutures.  We left an 18-French Robinson through the stomag and secured this to the skin with silk sutures.  The Malecot and stents were also secured in a similar fashion.,We matured the stoma to the umbilicus with interrupted chromic stitches.  The stitch was brought out to the right upper quadrant and the Malecot to the left lower quadrant.  A Large JP drain was placed in the pelvis dependent to the omentum pedicle flap as well as the Indiana pouch.,The rectus fascia was closed with a buried #2 Prolene running stitch, tying a new figure-of-eight proximally and distally and meeting in the middle and tying it underneath the fascia.  Subcutaneous tissue was irrigated with saline and skin was closed with surgical clips.  The estimated blood loss was 450 mL, and the patient received no packed red blood cells.  The final sponge and needle count were reported to be correct.

The patient's scrotal area was shaved, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A midline scrotal incision was made measuring about 2 cm in size.  The incision was carried through the dartos through the scrotal sac and the spermatocele was identified.  All the layers of the spermatocele were removed.  Clear layer was visualized, was taken all the way up to the base, the base was tied.  Entire spermatocele sac was removed.  After removing the entire spermatocele sac, hemostasis was obtained.  The testicle was not in normal orientation.  The testis and epididymis was removed, which is a small appendage on the superior aspect of the testicle.  The testicle was placed in a normal orientation.  Careful attention was drawn not to twist the cord.  Orchidopexy was done to allow the testes to stay stable in the postoperative period using 4-0 Vicryl and was tied at 3 different locations.  Absorbable sutures were used, so that the patient does not feel the sutures in the postoperative period.  The dartos was closed using 2-0 Vicryl in running locking fashion.  There was excellent hemostasis.  The skin was closed using 4-0 Monocryl.  Dermabond was applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.

There was no actual torsion at the present time, there was some modest congestion and, however, the vasculature was markedly congested down the cord.  The penis fascia was cauterized and subdartos pouch was created.  The upper aspect of fascia was then closed with pursestring suture of 4-0 chromic.  The testis was then placed into the scrotum in a proper orientation.  No tacking sutures within the testis itself were used.  The tunica vaginalis; however, was wrapped perfectly behind the back of the testis.  A similar procedure was performed on the right side.  Again, an appendix testis was cauterized.  No torsion was seen.  He also had a bell-clapper deformity and similar dartos pouch was created and the testis was placed in the scrotum in the proper orientation and the upper aspect closed with #4-0 chromic suture.  The local anesthetic was then used for both as cord block, as well as a local wound insufflation bilaterally with 0.25% Marcaine.  The scrotal wall was then closed with subcuticular closure of #4-0 chromic.  Dermabond tissue adhesive was then used.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.  He was given IV Toradol and was taken to the recovery room in stable condition.","urology, de-torsed bilateral testes, testes fixation, bell clapper deformity, testicular torsion, subdartos pouch, tunica vaginalis, scrotal exploration, appendix testes, scrotal, testes, torsion, detorsion, insufflation, testis, ","{'Name': 'Patient', 'Age': '4', 'Gender': 'Male', 'Symptoms': ['Left testicular pain', 'Abrupt onset of pain'], 'Diagnoses': ['Left testicular torsion', 'Possible detorsion', 'Bell-clapper deformity'], 'Medications': ['Marcaine', 'Toradol'], 'Tests': ['Ultrasound']}"

It was subsequently obstructed with multiple episodes of pyelonephritis, two percutaneous tube placements, ureteroscopy with balloon dilation of the system, and continued obstruction.  Plan is for co surgeons due to the complexity of the situation and the solitary kidney to do surgical procedure to correct the obstruction.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operative room.  Surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Dr. X and Dr. Y both agreed upon the procedures in advance.  Dr. Y then, once the patient was anesthetized, requested IV antibiotics with Fortaz, the patient had a caudal block placed, and he was then placed in lithotomy position.  Dr. Y then calibrated the urethra with the bougie a boule to 8, 10, and up to 12 French.  The 9.5-French cystoscope sheath was then placed within the patient's bladder with the offset scope, and his bladder had no evidence of cystitis.  I was able to locate the ureteral orifice bilaterally, although no urine coming from the right.  We then placed a 4-French ureteral catheter into the ureter as far as we could go.  An antegrade nephrostogram was then performed, which shows that the contrast filled the dilated pelvis, but did not go into the ureter.  A retrograde was performed, and it was found that there was a narrowed band across the two.  Upon draining the ureter allowing to drain to gravity, the pelvis which had been clamped and its nephrostomy tube did not drain at all.  Dr. Y then placed a 0.035 guidewire into the ureter after removing the 4-French catheter and then placed a 4.7-French double-J catheter into the ureter as far as it would go allowing it to coil in the bladder.  Once this was completed, we then removed the cystoscope and sheath, placed a 10-French Foley catheter, and the patient was positioned by Dr. X and Dr. Y into the flank position with the left flank up after adequate padding on the arms and legs as well as a brachial plexus roll.  He was then sterilely prepped and draped.  Dr. Y then incised the skin with a 15-blade knife through the old incision and then extended the incision with curved mosquito clamp and Dr. X performed cautery of the areas advanced to be excised.  Once this was then dissected, Dr. Y and Dr. X divided the lumbosacral fascia; at the latissimus dorsi fascia, posterior dorsal lumbotomy maneuver using the electrocautery; and then using curved mosquito clamps __________.  At this point, Dr. X used the cautery to enter the posterior retroperitoneal space through the posterior abdominal fascia.  Dr. Y then used the curved right angle clamp and dissected around towards the ureter, which was markedly adherent to the base of the retroperitoneum.  Dr. X and Dr. Y also needed dissection on the medial and lateral aspects with Dr. Y being on the lateral aspect of the area and Dr. X on the medial to get an adequate length of this.  The tissue was markedly inflamed and had significant adhesions noted.  The patient's spermatic vessels were also in the region as well as the renal vessels markedly scarred close to the ureteropelvic junction.  Ultimately, Dr. Y and Dr. X both with alternating dissection were able to dissect the renal pelvis to a position where Dr. Y put stay sutures and a 4-0 chromic to isolate the four quadrant area where we replaced the ureter.  Dr. X then divided the ureter and suture ligated the base, which was obstructed with a 3-0 chromic suture.  Dr. Y then spatulated the ureter for about 1.5 cm, and the stent was gently delivered in a normal location out of the ureter at the proximal and left alone in the bladder.  Dr. Y then incised the renal pelvis and dissected and opened it enough to allow the new ureteropelvic junction repair to be performed.  Dr. Y then placed interrupted sutures of 5-0 Monocryl at the apex to repair the most dependent portion of the renal pelvis, entered the lateral aspect, interrupted sutures of the repair.  Dr. X then was able to without much difficulty do interrupted sutures on the medial aspect.  The stent was then placed into the bladder in the proper orientation and alternating sutures by Dr. Y and Dr. X closed the ureteropelvic junction without any evidence of leakage.  Once this was complete, we removed the extra stay stitches and watched the ureter lay back into the retroperitoneum in a normal position without any kinking in apparently good position.  This opening was at least 1.5 cm wide.  Dr. Y then placed 2 stay sutures of 2-0 chromic in the lower pole of the kidney and then incised wedge biopsy and excised the biopsy with a 15-blade knife and curved iris scissors for renal biopsy for determination of renal tissue health.  Electrocautery was used on the base.  There was no bleeding, however, and the tissue was quite soft.  Dermabond and Gelfoam were placed, and then Dr. Y closed the biopsy site over with thrombin-Gelfoam using the 2-0 chromic stay sutures.  Dr. X then closed the fascial layers with running suture of 3-0 Vicryl in 3 layers.  Dr. Y closed the Scarpa fascia and the skin with 4-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Rapide respectively.  A 4-0 nylon suture was then placed by Dr. Y around the previous nephrostomy tube, which was again left clamped.  Dermabond tissue adhesive was placed over the incision and then a dry sterile dressing was placed by Dr. Y over the nephrostomy tube site, which was left clamped, and the patient then had a Foley catheter placed in the bladder.  The Foley catheter was then taped to his leg.  A second caudal block was placed for anesthesia, and he is in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room.","urology, cystoscopy, pyeloureteroscopy, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, pseudomonas pyelonephritis, renal insufficiency, fortaz, ureteropelvic junction repair, nephrostomy tube, renal biopsy, renal pelvis, foley catheter, ureteropelvic junction, renal, ureteropelvic,","{'Name': 'Unknown', 'Age': '3.5 years', 'Gender': 'Male', 'Symptoms': ['Left obstructed renal ureteropelvic junction obstruction', 'Renal insufficiency', 'Multiple episodes of pyelonephritis', 'Continued obstruction', 'Dilated ureter', 'Dilated renal pelvis', 'Stenotic scarred ureteropelvic junction'], 'Diagnoses': ['Left obstructed renal ureteropelvic junction obstruction status post pyeloplasty, percutaneous procedure, and pyeloureteroscopy x2', 'Pseudomonas pyelonephritis x6', 'Renal insufficiency', 'Solitary kidney'], 'Medications': ['Fortaz (IV antibiotics)'], 'Tests': ['Cystoscopy', 'Retrograde pyeloureteroscopy', 'Antegrade pyeloureteroscopy', 'Renal biopsy', 'Nephrostogram']}"

My camera ports were then placed in the standard fan array.  A camera port was placed in the midline above the umbilicus using the Hasson technique.  The balloon port was placed, the abdomen insufflated, and all other ports were placed under direct vision.  My assistant was on the right.  The patient was then placed in the steep Trendelenburg position, and the robot brought forward and appropriately docked.,I then proceeded to drop the bladder into the peritoneal cavity by incising between the right and left medial umbilical ligaments and carrying that dissection laterally along these ligaments deep into the pelvis.  This nicely exposed the space of Retzius.  I then defatted the anterior surface of the prostate and endopelvic fascia.,The endopelvic fascia was then opened bilaterally.  The levator ani muscles were carefully dissected free from the prostate and pushed laterally.  Dissection was continued posteriorly toward the bundles and caudally to the apex.  The puboprostatic ligaments were then transected.  A secure ligature of 0 Vicryl was placed around the dorsal venous complex.,I then approached the bladder neck.  The anterior bladder neck was transected down to the level of the Foley catheter, which was lifted anteriorly in the wound.  I then transected the posterior bladder neck down to the level of the ampullae of the vas.  The ampullae were mobilized and transected.  These were lifted anteriorly in the field, exposing the seminal vesicles, which were similarly mobilized.  Hemostasis was obtained using the bipolar Bovie.,I then identified the Denonvilliers fascia, and this was incised sharply.  Dissection was continued caudally along the anterior surface of the rectum and laterally toward the bundles.  I was able to then identify the pedicles over the seminal vesicles, which were hemoclipped and transected.,The field was then copiously irrigated with sterile water.  Hemostasis was found to be complete.  I then carried out a urethrovesical anastomosis.  This was accomplished with 3-0 Monocryl ligatures.  Two of these were tied together in the midline.  They were placed at the 6 o'clock position, and one was run in a clockwise and the other in a counterclockwise direction to the 12 o'clock position where they were securely tied.  A new Foley catheter was then easily delivered into the bladder and irrigated without extravasation.  The patient was given indigo carmine, and there was prompt blue urine in the Foley., ,I then carried out a bladder suspension.  This was done in hopes of obtaining early urinary control.  This was accomplished with 0 Vicryl ligatures.  One was placed at the bladder neck and through the dorsal venous complex and then the other along the anterior surface of the bladder to the posterior surface of the pubis.  This nicely re-retroperitonealized the bladder.,The prostate was then placed in an Endocatch bag and brought out through an extended camera port incision.  A JP drain was brought in through the 4th arm port and sutured to the skin with 2-0 silk.  The camera port fascia was closed with running 0 Vicryl.  The skin incisions were closed with a running, subcuticular 4-0 Monocryl.,The patient tolerated the procedure very well.  There were no complications.

Incontinence.,4.  Impotence.,5.  Deep venous thrombosis.,6.  Recurrence of the cancer.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , Epidural anesthesia was administered by the anesthesiologist in the holding area.  Preoperative antibiotic was also given in the preoperative holding area.  The patient was then taken into the operating room after which general LMA anesthesia was administered.  The patient was shaved and then prepped using Betadine solution.  A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was inserted into the bladder with clear urine drain.  A midline infraumbilical incision was performed.  The rectus fascia was opened sharply.  The perivesical space and the retropubic space were developed bluntly.  Bookwalter retractor was then placed.  Bilateral obturator pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed.  The obturator nerve was identified and was untouched.  The margin for the resection of the lymph node bilaterally were the Cooper's ligament, the medial edge of the external iliac artery, the bifurcation of the common iliac vein, the obturator nerve, and the bladder.  Both hemostasis and lymphostasis was achieved by using silk ties and Hemo clips.  The lymph nodes were palpably normal and were set for permanent section.  The Bookwalter retractor was then repositioned and the endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally using Metzenbaum scissors.  The puboprostatic ligament was taken down sharply.  The superficial dorsal vein complex over the prostate was bunched up by using the Allis clamp and then tied by using 2-0 silk sutures.  The deep dorsal vein complex was then bunched up by using the Allis over the membranous urethral area.  The dorsal vein complex was ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture on a CT-1 needle.  The Allis clamp was removed and the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors.  The urethra was then identified and was dissected out.  The urethral opening was made just distal to the apex of the prostate by using Metzenbaum scissors.  This was extended circumferentially until the Foley catheter could be seen clearly.  2-0 Monocryl sutures were then placed on the urethral stump evenly spaced out for the anastomosis to be performed later.  The Foley catheter was removed and the posteriormost aspect of urethra and rectourethralis muscle was transected.  The lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally to sweep the neurovascular bundles laterally on both sides.  The plane between Denonvilliers' fascia and the perirectal fat was developed sharply.  No tension was placed on the neurovascular bundle at any point in time.  The prostate dissected off the rectal wall easily.  Once the seminal vesicles were identified, the fascia covering over them were opened transversely.  The seminal vesicles were dissected out and the small bleeding vessels leading to them were clipped by using medium clips and then transected.  The bladder neck was then dissected out carefully to spare most of the bladder neck muscles.  Once all of the prostate had been dissected off the bladder neck circumferentially the mucosa lining the bladder neck was transected releasing the entire specimen.  The specimen was inspected and appeared to be completely intact.  It was sent for permanent section.  The bladder neck mucosa was then everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures.  Inspection at the prostatic bed revealed no bleeding vessels.  The sutures, which were placed previously onto the urethral stump, were then placed onto the bladder neck.  Once the posterior sutures had been placed, the Foley was placed into the urethra and into the bladder neck.  A 20-French Foley Catheter was used.  The anterior sutures were then placed.  The Foley was then inflated.  The bed was straightened and the sutures were tied down sequentially from anteriorly to posteriorly.  Mild traction of the Foley catheter was placed to assure the anastomosis was tight.  Two #19-French Blake drains were placed in the perivesical spaces.  These were anchored to the skin by using 2-0 silk sutures.  The instrument counts, lab counts, and sponge counts were verified to be correct, the patient was closed.  The fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS.  Subcutaneous tissue was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl suture.  Skin was approximated by using metallic clips.

Due to him being healthy with no comorbid conditions, he has elected to undergo surgical treatment with radical retropubic prostatectomy.  Potential complications include, but are not limited to:,1.  Infection.,2.  Bleeding.,3.  Incontinence.,4.  Impotence.,5.  Injury to the adjacent viscera.,6.  Deep venous thrombosis.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , Prophylactic antibiotic was given in the preoperative holding area, after which the patient was transferred to the operating room.  Epidural anesthesia and general endotracheal anesthesia were administered by Dr. A without any difficulty.  The patient was shaved, prepped, and draped using the usual sterile technique.  A sterile 16-French Foley catheter was then placed with clear urine drained.  A midline infraumbilical incision was performed by using a #10 scalpel blade.  The rectus fascia and the subcutaneous space were opened by using the Bovie.  Transversalis fascia was opened in the midline and the retropubic space and the paravesical space were developed bluntly.  A Bookwalter retractor was then placed.  The area of the obturator lymph nodes were carefully inspected and no suspicious adenopathy was detected.  Given this patient's low Gleason score and low PSA with a solitary core biopsy positive, the decision was made to not perform bilateral lymphadenectomy.  The endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally by using the Metzenbaum scissors.  Opening was enlarged by using sharp dissection.  Small perforating veins from the prostate into the lateral pelvic wall were controlled by using bipolar coagulation device.  The dorsal aspect of the prostate was bunched up by using 2-0 silk sutures.  The deep dorsal vein complex was bunched up by using Allis also and ligated by using 0 Vicryl suture in a figure-of-eight fashion.  With the prostate retracted cephalad, the deep dorsal vein complex was transected superficially using the Bovie.  Deeper near the urethra, the dorsal vein complex was transected by using Metzenbaum scissors.  The urethra could then be easily identified.  Nearly two-third of the urethra from anteriorly to posteriorly was opened by using Metzenbaum scissors.  This exposed the blue Foley catheter.  Anastomotic sutures were then placed on to the urethral stump using 2-0 Monocryl suture.  Six of these were placed evenly spaced out anteriorly to posteriorly.  The Foley catheter was then removed.  This allowed for better traction of the prostate laterally.  Lateral pelvic fascia was opened bilaterally.  This effectively released the neurovascular bundle from the apex to the base of the prostate.  Continued dissection from the lateral pelvic fascia deeply opened up the plane into the perirectal fat.  The prostate was then dissected from laterally to medially from this opening in the perirectal fat.  The floor of the urethra posteriorly and the rectourethralis muscle was then transected just distal to the prostate.  Maximal length of ureteral stump was preserved.  The prostate was carefully lifted cephalad by using gentle traction with fine forceps.  The prostate was easily dissected off the perirectal fat using sharp dissection only.  Absolutely, no traction to the neurovascular bundle was evident at any point in time.  The dissection was carried out easily until the seminal vesicles could be visualized.  The prostate pedicles were controlled easily by using multiple medium clips in 4 to 5 separate small bundles on each side.  The bladder neck was then dissected out by using a bladder neck dissection method.  Unfortunately, most of the bladder neck fiber could not be preserved due to the patient's anatomy.  Once the prostate had been separated from the bladder in the area with the bladder neck, dissection was carried out posteriorly to develop a plane between the bladder and the seminal vesicles.  This was developed without any difficulty.  Both vas deferens were identified, hemoclipped and transected.  The seminal vesicles on both sides were quite large and a decision was made to not completely dissect the tip off, as it extended quite deeply into the pelvis.  About two-thirds of the seminal vesicles were able to be removed.  The tip was left behind.  Using the bipolar Gyrus coagulation device, the seminal vesicles were clamped at the tip sealed by cautery and then transected.  This was performed on the left side and then the right side.  This completely freed the prostate.  The prostate was sent for permanent section.  The opening in the bladder neck was reduced by using two separate 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The mucosa of the bladder neck was everted by using 4-0 chromic sutures.  Small amount of bleeding around the area of the posterior bladder wall was controlled by using suture ligature.  The ureteral orifice could be seen easily from the bladder neck opening and was completely away from the everting sutures.  The previously placed anastomotic suture on the urethral stump was then placed on the corresponding position on the bladder neck.  This was performed by using a French ***** needle.  A 20-French Foley catheter was then inserted and the sutures were sequentially tied down.  A 15 mL of sterile water was inflated to balloon.  The bladder anastomosis to the urethra was performed without any difficulty.  A 19-French Blake Drain was placed in the left pelvis exiting the right inguinal region.  All instrument counts, lap counts, and latex were verified twice prior to the closure.  The rectus fascia was closed in running fashion using #1 PDS.  Subcutaneous space was closed by using 2-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was reapproximated by using metallic clips.

Up on consideration of various modalities and therapy, the patient decided to undergo surgical therapy.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was verified by armband and the procedure being robotic-assisted right pyeloplasty with nephrolithotomy was verified, and the procedure was carried out.  After institution of general endotracheal anesthesia and intravenous preoperative antibiotics, the patient was positioned into the right flank position with his right flank elevated.  Great care was taken to pad all pressure points and a right arm hanger was used.  The patient was flexed slightly, and a kidney rest was used.  Sequential compression devices were also placed.  Next, the patient was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion with povidone-iodine.  Pneumoperitoneum was obtained by placing a Veress needle in the area of the umbilicus after it passed the water test.  A low pressure, high flow pneumoperitoneum was adequately obtained using CO2 gas.  Next, a 12-mm camera port was placed near the umbilicus.  The camera was inserted, and no bowel injury was seen.  Next, under direct vision flanking 8 mm camera ports, a 12 mm assist port, a 5 mm liver retraction port, and 5 mm assist port were placed.  The robot was docked and the instruments passed through respective checks.  Initial attention was directed to mobilizing the right colon from the abdominal wall totally medially.  Next, the right lateral duodenum was cauterized for further access to the right retroperitoneum.  At this point, the right kidney was in clear view, and the fascia was entered.  Initial attention was directed at careful dissection of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter which was done with a combination of electrocautery and blunt dissection.  It became readily apparent that there were two crossing vessels one in the medial inferior region of the kidney and another one in the most inferior portion of the lower pole.  These arteries were dissected carefully and vessel loops were applied.  Next, a small hole was then made in the renal pelvis using electrocautery and the contents of the renal pelvis were suctioned out.  The pyelotomy was extended so that the renal collecting system could be directly inspected.  Sequentially, each major calyx was inspected under direct vision and irrigated.  A total of four round kidney stones were extracted to be sent for analysis to being satisfied for the patient.  At this point, we directed our attention at the proximal right ureter which was dismembered from the remaining renal pelvis.  The proximal ureter was spatulated using cold scissors.  Next, redundant renal pelvis was excised using cold scissors and sent for permanent section.  We then identified the most inferior/dependent portion of the renal pelvis and placed a heel stitch at this for ureteral-renal pelvis anastomosis in a semi running fashion.  3-0 Monocryl sutures were used to re-anastomose the newly spatulated right ureter to the inferior portion of the renal pelvis.  Next, remainder of the pyelotomy was closed to itself also using 2-0 Monocryl sutures.  Before final stitches were placed, a 6x28 ureteral stent was placed anterograde.  This was accomplished by placing the stents over a guidewire, placing the guidewire under direct vision anterograde through the ureter.  This was done until the proximal end was in the renal pelvis, the guidewire was removed, and good proximal curl was verified by direct vision.  Then, the pyelotomy was completely closed again with 2-0 Monocryl sutures.  Next, attention was directed at transposition of the crossing renal artery by fixing it with Vicryl suture that would impinge less upon the renal pelvis.  Good pulsation was verified by direct vision proximal and distal to these pexy sutures.  Next, Gerota's fascia was reapproximated and closed with Vicryl sutures as was the right peritoneum.  Hemostasis appeared excellent at this point.  There was no obvious urine extravasation.  At this time, the procedure was terminated.  The robot was undocked.  Under direct visualization all 8 and 12 mm ports were closed at the level of the fascia with 0 Vicryl sutures in an interrupted fashion.  Then, all skin port sites were closed with 4-0 Monocryl in a subcuticular fashion and Dermabond and band-aids were applied over this.  Also, notably a Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the area of the right kidney and additional right flank stab incision.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and no immediate perioperative complication was noted.,DISPOSITION: , The patient was discharged to Post Anesthesia Care Unit and subsequently to genitourinary floor to begin his recovery.","urology, pyeloplasty, ureteral stent placement, nephrolithotomy, ureteropelvic junction obstruction, jackson-pratt drain, foley catheter, renal pelvis, kidney stones, monocryl sutures, pelvis, renal, ureteropelvic, sutures, ","{'Name': 'Unknown', 'Age': '30', 'Gender': 'Male', 'Symptoms': ['Hematuria', 'Right renal stones', 'Patulous right collecting system'], 'Diagnoses': ['Right ureteropelvic junction obstruction'], 'Medications': ['Intravenous preoperative antibiotics'], 'Tests': ['Analysis of kidney stones']}"

There was noted to be some tightness of the urethra on passage.  On visualization of the bladder, there were no stones or any other debris within the bladder.  There were no abnormalities seen.  No masses, diverticuli, or other abnormal findings.  Attention was then turned to the right ureteral orifice and attempts to pass to a cone tip catheter, however, the ureteral orifice was noted to be also tight and we were unable to pass the cone tip catheter.  The cone tip catheter was removed and a glidewire was then passed without difficulty up into the renal pelvis.  An open-end ureteral catheter was then passed ________ into the distal right ureter.  Retrograde pyelogram was then performed.,There was noted to be an UPJ calculus with no noted hydronephrosis.  The wire was then passed back through the ureteral catheter.

His previous PSAs were in the 1 range.  TRUS biopsy revealed 4+3 Gleason score prostate cancer with a large tumor burden.  After extensive counseling, the patient elected for retropubic radical prostatectomy.  Given his disease burden, it was advised that an open prostatectomy is probably the standard of care to ensure entire excision.  The patient consented and agreed to proceed forward.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: , The patient was brought to the operating room here.  Time out was taken to properly identify the patient and procedure going to be done.  General anesthesia was induced.  The patient was placed in the supine position.  The bed was flexed distant to the pubic area.  The patient's lower abdominal area, pubic area, and penile and scrotal area were clipped, and then scrubbed with Hibiclens soap for three minutes.  The patient was then prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion.  Foley catheter was inserted sterilely in the field.  Preoperative antibiotics were given within 30 minutes of skin incision.  A 10 cm lower abdominal incision was made from the symphysis pubis towards the umbilicus.  Dissection was taken down through Scarpa's fascia to the level of the anterior rectus sheath.  The rectus sheath was then incised and the muscle was split in the middle.  Space of rectus sheath was then entered.  The Bookwalter ring was then applied to the belly, and the bladder was then retracted to the right side, thus exposing the left obturator area.  The lymph node packet on the left side was then dissected.  This was done in a split and roll fashion with the flimsy tissue, and the left external iliac vein was incised, and the tissues were then rolled over the left external iliac vein.  Dissection was carried down from the left external iliac vein to the obturator nerve and up to the level of the pelvic sidewall.  The proximal extent of dissection was the left hypogastric artery to the level of the node of Cloquet distally.  Care was taken to avoid injury to the nerves.  An accessory obturator vein was noted and was ligated.  The same procedure was done on the right side with dissection of the right obturator lymph node packet, which was sent for pathologic evaluation.  The bladder subsequently was retracted cephalad.  The prostate was then defatted up to the level of the endopelvic fascia.  The endopelvic fascia was then incised bilaterally, and the incision was then taken to the level of the puboprostatic ligaments.  Vicryl stitch was then applied at the level of the bladder neck in order to control the bladder back bleeders.  A Babcock was then applied around the dorsal venous complex over the urethra and the K-wire was then passed between the dorsal vein complex and the urethra by passing by the aid of a right angle.  A 0-Vicryl stitch was then applied over the dorsal venous complex, which was then tied down and cinched to the symphysis pubis.  Using a knife on a long handle, the dorsal venous complex was then incised using the K-wire as a guide.  Following the incision of the dorsal venous complex, the anterior urethra was then incised, thus exposing the Foley catheter.  The 3-0 Monocryl sutures were then applied going outside in on the anterior aspect of the urethra.  The lateral edges of the urethra were also then incised, and two lateral stitches were also applied going outside end.  The catheter was then drawn back at the level of membranous urethra, and a final posterior stitch was applied going outside end.  The urethra was subsequently divided in its entirety.  A Foley catheter was then taken out and was inserted directly into the bladder through the prostatic apex.  The prostate was then entered cephalad, and the prostatic pedicles were then systematically taken down with the right angle clips and cut.  Please note that throughout the case, the patient was noted to have significant oozing and bleeding partially from the dorsal venous complex, pelvic veins, and extensive vascularity that was noted in the patient's pelvic fatty tissue.  Throughout the case, the bleeding was controlled with the aid of a clips, Vicryl sutures, silk sutures, and ties, direct pressure packing, and FloSeal.  Following the excision of the prostatic pedicles, the posterior dissection at this point was almost complete.  Please note that the dissection was relatively technically challenging due to extensive adhesions between the prostate and Denonvilliers' fascia.  The seminal vesicle on the left side was dissected in its entirety; however, the seminal vesicle on the right side was adherently stuck to the Denonvilliers' fascia, which prompted the excision of most of the right seminal vesicle with the exception of the tip.  Care was taken throughout the posterior dissection to preserve the integrity of the ureters.  The anterior bladder neck was then cut anteriorly, and the bladder neck was separated from the prostate.  Following the dissection, the 5-French feeding tubes were inserted bilaterally into the ureters thus insuring their integrity.  Following the dissection of the bladder from the prostate, the prostate at this point was mobile and was sent for pathological evaluation.  The bladder neck was then repaired using Vicryl in a tennis racquet fashion.  The rest of the mucosa was then everted.  The ureteral orifices and ureters were protected throughout the procedure.  At this point, the initial sutures that were applied into the urethra were then applied into the corresponding position on the bladder neck, and the bladder neck was then cinched down and tied down after a new Foley catheter was inserted through the penile meatus and into the bladder pulling the bladder in position.  Hemostasis was then adequately obtained.  FloSeal was applied to the pelvis.  The bladder was then irrigated.  It was draining pink urine.  The wound was copiously irrigated.  The fascia was then closed using a #1 looped PDS.  The skin wound was then irrigated, and the skin was closed with a 4-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  At this point, the procedure was terminated with no complications.  The patient was then extubated in the operating room and taken in stable condition to the PACU.  Please note that during the case about 3600 mL of blood was noted.  This was due to the persistent continuous oozing from vascular fatty tissue and pelvic veins as previously noted in the dictation.","urology, bilateral lymph node dissection, retropubic prostatectomy, radical retropubic prostatectomy, gleason score, prostate cancer, trus, biopsy, bilateral lymph node, lymph node dissection, catheter was inserted, bilateral lymph, node dissection, vicryl stitch, prostatic pedicles, pelvic veins, external iliac, iliac vein, seminal vesicle, lymph node, foley catheter, dorsal venous, venous complex, bladder neck, dissection, prostatectomy, bladder, endopelvic, vicryl, catheter, vein, venous, fascia, dorsal, urethra, ","{'Name': 'Not specified', 'Age': '66', 'Gender': 'Male', 'Symptoms': 'Elevated PSA', 'Diagnoses': 'Prostate cancer, Gleason score 4+3 with 85% burden and 8/12 cores positive', 'Medications': 'Preoperative antibiotics', 'Tests': 'TRUS biopsy, PSA test, Pathologic evaluation of lymph nodes and prostate'}"

General endotracheal intubation was performed by the Anesthesia Department and the perineum, scrotum, penis, and lower abdomen from the umbilicus down was prepped and draped in the sterile fashion in a 15-minute prep including iodine solution in the urethra.  The bladder was subsequently drained with a red Robinson catheter.  At that point, the patient was then draped in a sterile fashion and an infraumbilical midline incision was made and taken down through the subcutaneous space.  Care was maintained to avoid all bleeding as possible secondary to the fact that we could not use Bovie cautery secondary to the patient's pacemaker and monopolar was only source of hemostasis besides suture.  At that point, we got down to the fascia and the dorsal venous complex was easily identified as were both corporal bodies.  Attention was taken then to the tubing, going up to the reservoir in the right lower quadrant.  This was dissected out bluntly and sharply with Metzenbaum scissors and monopolar used for hemostasis.  At this point, as we tracked this proximally to the area of the rectus muscle, we found that the tubing was violated and this was likely the source of his malfunctioned inflatable penile prosthesis.  As we tried to remove the tubing and get to the reservoir, the tubing in fact completely broke as due to wire inside the tubing and the reservoir was left in its place secondary to risk of going after it and bleeding without the use of cautery.  At that point, this tubing was then tracked down to the pump, which was fairly easily removed from the dartos pouch in the right scrotum.  This was brought up into _________ incision and the two tubings going towards the two cylinders were subsequently tracked, first starting on the right side where a corporotomy incision was made at the placement of two #3-0 Prolene stay ties, staying lateral and anterior on the corporal body.  The corporal body was opened up and the cylinder was removed from the right side without difficulty.  However, we did have significant difficulty separating the tube connecting the pump to the right cylinder since this was surrounded by dense connective tissue and without the use of Bovie cautery, this was very difficult and was very time consuming, but we were able to do this and attention was then taken to the left side where the left proximal corporotomy was made after placement of two stick tie stay sutures.  This was done anterior and lateral staying away from the neurovascular bundle in the midline and this was done proximally on the corporal body.  The left cylinder was then subsequently explanted and this was very difficult as well trying to tract the tubing from the left cylinder across the midline back to the right pump since this was also densely scarred in and _________ a small amount of bleeding, which was controlled with monopolar and cautery was used on three different occasions, but just simple small burst under the guidance of anesthesia and there was no ectopy noted.  After removal of half of the pump, all the tubing, and both cylinders, these were passed off the table as specimen.  Both corporal bodies were then dilated with the Pratt dilators.  These were already fairly well dilated secondary to explantation of our cylinders and antibiotic irrigation was copiously used at this point and irrigated out both of our corporal spaces.  At this point, using the Farlow device, corporal bodies were measured first proximally then distally and they both measured out to be 9 cm proximally and 12 cm distally.  He had an 18 cm with rear tips in place, which were removed.  We decided to go ahead to and use another 18 cm inflatable penile prosthesis.  Confident with our size, we then placed rear tips, originally 3 cm rear tips, however, we had difficulty placing the rear tips into the left crest.  We felt that this was just a little bit too long and replaced both rear tips and down sized from 2 cm to 1 cm.  At this point, we went ahead and placed the right cylinder using the Farlow device and the Keith needle, which was brought out through the glans penis and hemostated and the posterior rear tip was subsequently placed proximally, entered the crest without difficulty.  Attention was then taken to the left side with the same thing was carried out, however, we did happen to dilate on two separate occasions both proximally and distally secondary to a very snug fit as well as buckling of the cylinders.  This then forced us to down size to the 1 cm rear tips, which slipping very easily with the Farlow device through the glans penis.  There was no crossover and no violation of the tunica albuginea.  The rear tips were then placed without difficulty and our corporotomies were closed with #2-0 PDS in a running fashion.  ________ starting on the patient's right side and then on the left side without difficulty and care was maintained to avoid damage or needle injury to the implants.  At that point, the wound was copiously irrigated and the device was inflated multiple times.  There was a very good fit and we had a very good result.  At that point, the pump was subsequently placed in the dartos pouch, which already has been created and was copiously irrigated with antibiotic solution.  This was held in place with a Babcock as well not to migrate proximally and attention was then taken to our connection from the reservoir to the pump.  Please also note that before placement of our pump, attention was then taken up to the left lower quadrant where an incision was then made in external oblique aponeurosis, approximately 3 cm dissection down underneath the rectus space was developed for our reservoir device, which was subsequently placed without difficulty and three simple interrupted sutures of #2-0 Vicryl used to close the defect in the rectus and at that point after placement of our pump, the connection was made between the pump and the reservoir without difficulty.  The entire system pump and corporal bodies were subsequently flushed and all air bubbles were evacuated.  After completion of the connection using a straight connector, the prosthesis was inflated and we had very good results with air inflation with good erection in both cylinders with a very slight deviation to the left, but this was able to be ________ with good cosmetic result.  At that point, after irrigation again of the space, the area was simply dry and hemostatic.  The soft tissue was reapproximated to separate the cylinder so as not to lie in rope against one another and the wound was closed in multiple layers.  The soft tissue and the skin was then reapproximated with staples.  Please also note that prior to the skin closure, a Jackson-Pratt drain was subsequently placed through the left skin and left lower quadrant and subsequently placed just over tubings, would be left in place for approximately 12 to 20 hours.  This was also sutured in place with nylon.  Sterile dressing was applied.  Light gauze was wrapped around the penis and/or sutures that begin at the tip of the glans penis were subsequently cut and removed in entirety bilaterally.  Coban was used then to wrap the penis and at the end of the case the patient was straight catheted, approximately 400 cc of amber-yellow urine.  No Foley catheter was used or placed.,The patient was awoken in the operative suite, extubated, and transferred to recovery room in stable condition.

Then he inserted a heart-shaped marble in one of the puncture wounds and inserted it under the skin and kept it there.  He was not significantly bleeding and essentially the bleeding stopped from both puncture wounds that he has.  Then today four days after that procedure, he was taking a bath today and he thinks because of the weight he felt a gush in his pants and he looked and he saw the bleeding come out.

The patient has been voiding without difficulty throughout.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: , The patient has no known allergies.  He was a term delivery via vaginal delivery.  Surgeries; he has had 2 circumcisions.  No other hospitalizations.  He has had no heart murmurs, seizures, asthma, or bronchitis.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: , A 14-point review of systems was negative with the exception of the penile and scrotal cellulitis and the surgeries as mentioned.  He also had an ear infection about 1 to 2 weeks before his circumcision.,SOCIAL HISTORY: , The patient lives with both parents and no siblings.  There are smokers at home.,MEDICATIONS: , Clindamycin and bacitracin ointment.  Also Bactrim.,PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:,VITAL SIGNS:  Weight is 14.9 kg.,GENERAL:  The patient was sleepy but easily arousable.,HEAD AND NECK:  Grossly normal.  His neck and chest are without masses.,NARES:  He had some crusted nares; otherwise, no other discharge.,LUNGS:  Clear.,CARDIAC:  Without murmurs or gallops.,ABDOMEN:  Soft without masses or tenderness.,GU:  He has a fairly prominent suprapubic fat pad, and he is quite a large child in any event; however, there were no signs of erythema.  There was some induration around the penis; however, there were no signs of active infection.  He has a buried appearance of the penis after recent circumcision with a normal appearing glans.  The tissue itself, however, was quite dull and is soft or readily retractable at this time.  The scrotum was normal, and there was no erythema, there was no tenderness.  Both testes were descended without hydroceles.,EXTREMITIES:  He has full range of motion of all 4 extremities.,SKIN:  Warm, pink, and dry.,NEUROLOGIC:  Grossly intact.,BACK:  Normal.,IMPRESSION/PLAN: , The patient had a recent circumcision with a fairly prominent suprapubic fat pad but also has a penile and suprapubic cellulitis.  This is being treated, but it is most likely Staph and pending sensitivities.  I talked to the mother and told her that at this point the swelling that is present is a mixture of the resolving cellulitis from a suprapubic fat pad.  I recommended that he be treated most likely with Bactrim for a 10-day course at home, bacitracin, or some antibiotics ointment to the penis with each diaper change for the next 2 to 3 weeks with sitz bath once or twice a day.  I told the mother that initially the tissues are going to be quite dull because of the infection and the recent surgery, but she ultimately will have to gently retract the skin to keep it from adhering again because of the prominent suprapubic fat pad, which makes it more likely.  Otherwise, it is a fairly healthy-appearing tissue at the present time and she knows the reasons that he cannot be discharged once the hospitalist service believes that it is appropriate to do so.  He has a scheduled followup appointment with his urologist  and he should keep that appointment or followup sooner if there is any other problem arising.","urology, newborn circumcision, suprapubic fat pad, penile cellulitis, penile swelling, cellulitis, penis, penile, suprapubic, circumcision, ","{'Name': 'Unknown', 'Age': '16 months', 'Gender': 'Male', 'Symptoms': ['Penile swelling', 'Fever', 'Purulent discharge', 'Scrotal swelling', 'Suprapubic region swelling', 'Penile cellulitis', 'Buried penis'], 'Diagnoses': ['Penile cellulitis', 'Staph infection (possible MRSA)', 'Buried penis'], 'Medications': ['Clindamycin', 'Bacitracin ointment', 'Bactrim'], 'Tests': ['Cultures (Staph)']}"
70," He continues to have abdominal pain, and he had a diuretic renal scan, which indicates no evidence of obstruction and good differential function bilaterally. ", Urology, Pediatric Urology Letter ,"XYZ, M.D. ,Suite 123, ABC Avenue ,City, STATE 12345 ,RE:  XXXX, XXXX ,MR#:  0000000,Dear Dr. XYZ: ,XXXX was seen in followup in the Pediatric Urology Clinic.  I appreciate you speaking with me while he was in clinic.  He continues to have abdominal pain, and he had a diuretic renal scan, which indicates no evidence of obstruction and good differential function bilaterally. ,When I examined him, he seems to indicate that his pain is essentially in the lower abdomen in the suprapubic region; however, on actual physical examination, he seems to complain of pain through his entire right side.  His parents have brought up the question of whether this could be gastrointestinal in origin and that is certainly an appropriate consideration.  They also feel that since he has been on Detrol, his pain levels have been somewhat worse, and so, I have given them the option of stopping the Detrol initially.  I think he should stay on MiraLax for management of his bowels.  I would also suggest that he be referred to Pediatric Gastroenterology for evaluation.  If they do not find any abnormalities from a gastrointestinal perspective, then the next step would be to endoscope his bladder and then make sure that he does not have any evidence of bladder anatomic abnormalities that is leading to this pain. ,Thank you for following XXXX along with us in Pediatric Urology Clinic.

Right orchiopexy.,2.  Right herniorrhaphy.,ANESTHESIA: , LMA.,ESTIMATED BLOOD LOSS: , Minimal.,SPECIMEN: , Sac.,BRIEF HISTORY: , This is a 10-year-old male who presented to us with his mom with consultation from Craig Connor at Cottonwood with right undescended testis.  The patient and mother had seen the testicle in the right hemiscrotum in the past, but the testicle seemed to be sliding.  The testis was identified right at the external inguinal ring.  The testis was unable to be brought down into the scrotal sac.  The patient could have had sliding testicle in the past and now the testis has become undescended as the child has grown.  Options such as watchful waiting and wait for puberty to stimulate the descent of the testicle, HCG stimulation, orchiopexy were discussed.  Risk of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, hernia, etc. were discussed.  The patient and parents understood and wanted to proceed with right orchiopexy and herniorrhaphy.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the OR, anesthesia was applied.  The patient was placed in supine position.  The patient was prepped and draped in the inguinal and scrotal area.  After the patient was prepped and draped, an inguinal incision was made on the right side about 1 cm away for the anterior superior iliac spine going towards the external ring over the inguinal canal.  The incision came through the subcutaneous tissue and external oblique fascia was identified.  The external oblique fascia was opened sharply and was taken all the way down towards the external ring.  The ilioinguinal nerve was identified right underneath the external oblique fascia, which was preserved and attention was drawn throughout the entire case to ensure that it was not under any tension or pinched or got hooked in the suture.  After dissecting proximally, the testis was identified in the distal end of the inguinal canal.  The testis was pulled up.  The cremasteric muscle was divided and dissection was carried all the way up to the internal inguinal ring.  There was very small hernia, which was removed and was tied at the base.  PDS suture was used to tie this hernia sac all the way up to the base.  There was a Y right at the vas and cord indicating there was enough length into the scrotal sac.  The testis was easily brought down into the scrotal sac.  One centimeter superior scrotal incision was made and a Dartos pouch was created.  The testicle was brought down into the pouch and was placed into the pouch.  Careful attention was done to ensure that there was no torsion of the cord.  The vas was medial all the way throughout and the cord was lateral all the way throughout.  The epididymis was in the posterolateral location.  The testicle was pexed using 4-0 Vicryl into the scrotal sac.  Skin was closed using 5-0 Monocryl.  The external oblique fascia was closed using 2-0 PDS.  Attention was drawn to re-create the external inguinal ring.  A small finger was easily placed in the external inguinal ring to ensure that there was no tightening of the cord.  Marcaine 0.25% was applied, about 15 mL worth of this was applied for local anesthesia.  After closing the external oblique fascia, the Scarpa was brought together using 4-0 Vicryl and the skin was closed using 5-0 Monocryl in subcuticular fashion.  Dermabond and Steri-Strips were applied.,The patient was brought to recovery room in stable condition at the end of the procedure.,Please note that the testicle was viable.  It was smaller than the other side, probably by 50%.  There were no palpable testicular masses.  Plan was for the patient to follow up with us in about 1 month.  The patient was told not to do any heavy lifting for at least 3 months, okay to shower in 48 hours.  No tub bath for 2 months.  The patient and family understood all the instructions.","urology, undescended testicle, orchiopexy & herniorrhaphy, external oblique fascia, inguinal ring, scrotal sac, oblique fascia, testicle, herniorrhaphy, orchiopexy, inguinal","{'Name': None, 'Age': '10', 'Gender': 'Male', 'Symptoms': ['Right undescended testicle', 'Testicle seems to be sliding', 'Testis was identified right at the external inguinal ring', 'The testis was unable to be brought down into the scrotal sac'], 'Diagnoses': ['Right undescended testicle', 'Small hernia'], 'Medications': ['Marcaine 0.25%'], 'Tests': []}"

Once he was anesthetized, he was then placed in a supine position, and sterilely prepped and draped.  A superior curvilinear scrotal incision was then made in the left hemiscrotum with a 15-blade knife and further extended with electrocautery into the subcutaneous tissue.  We then used the curved cryoclamp to dissect into the scrotal space and found the tunica vaginalis and dissected this up to the external ring.  We were able to dissect all the way up to the ring, but were unable to get the testis delivered.  We then made a left inguinal incision with a 15-blade knife, further extending with electrocautery through Scarpa fascia down to the external oblique fascia.  The testis again was not visualized in the external ring, so we brought the sac up from the scrotum into the inguinal incision and then incised the external oblique fascia with a 15-blade knife further extending with Metzenbaum scissors.  The testis itself was quite high up in the upper canal.  We then dissected the gubernacular structures off of the testis, and also, then opened the sac, and dissected the sac off and found that he had a communicating hernia hydrocele and dissected the sac off with curved and straight mosquitos and a straight Joseph scissors.  Once this was dissected off and up towards the internal ring, it was twisted upon itself and suture ligated with an 0 Vicryl suture.  We then dissected the lateral spermatic fascia, and then, using blunt dissection, dissected in the retroperitoneal space to get more cord length.  We also dissected the sac from the peritoneal reflection up into the abdomen once it had been tied off.  We then found that we had an adequate amount of cord length to get the testis in the mid-to-low scrotum.  The patient was found to have a type III epididymal attachment with a long looping vas, and we brought the testis into the scrotum in the proper orientation and tacked it to mid-to-low scrotum with a 4-0 chromic stay stitch.  The upper aspect of the subdartos pouch was closed with a 4-0 chromic pursestring suture.  The testis was then placed into the scrotum in the proper orientation.  We then placed the local anesthetic, and the ilioinguinal nerve block, and placed a small amount in both incisional areas as well.  We then closed the external oblique fascia with a running suture of 0-Vicryl ensuring that the ilioinguinal nerve and cord structures were not bottom closure.

Since the testis was in the ectopic position, we did an upper curvilinear scrotal incision with a 15-blade knife and further extended it with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was also used for hemostasis.  A subdartos pouch was then created with a curved tenotomy scissors.  The tunica vaginalis was grasped with a curved mosquito clamp and then dissected from its gubernacular attachments.  As we were dissecting it, we then found the testis itself into the sac, and we opened the sac, and it was found to be slightly atrophic about 12 mm in length and had a type III epididymal attachment, not being attached to the top.  We then dissected the hernia sac off of the testis __________ some traction using the straight Joseph scissors and straight and curved mosquito clamps.  Once this was dissected off, we then twisted it upon itself, and then dissected it down towards the external ring, but on traction.

Ultrasound showed metastasis to be high in the left inguinal canal.  The right testis is located in the right inguinal canal on ultrasound and apparently ultrasound could not be displaced into the right hemiscrotum.  Both testes appeared to be normal in size for the boy's age.,OPERATIVE FINDINGS: , As above, both testes appeared viable and normal in size, no masses.  There is a hernia on the left side.  The spermatic cord was quite short on the left and required Prentiss Maneuver to achieve adequate length for scrotal placement.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE: , The boy was taken to the operating room, where he was placed on the operating table.  General anesthesia was administered by Dr. X, after which the boy's lower abdomen and genitalia were prepared with Betadine and draped aseptically.  A 0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated subcutaneously in the skin crease in the left groin in the area of the intended incision.  An inguinal incision was then made through this area, carried through the subcutaneous tissues to the anterior fascia.  External ring was exposed with dissection as well.  The fascia was opened in direction of its fibers exposing the testes, which lay high in the canal.  The testes were freed with dissection by removing cremasteric and spermatic fascia.  The hernia sac was separated from the cord, twisted and suture ligated at the internal ring.  Lateral investing bands of the spermatic cords were divided high into the inguinal internal ring.  However, this would only allow placement of the testes in the upper scrotum with some tension.,Therefore, the left inguinal canal was incised and the inferior epigastric artery and vein were ligated with #4-0 Vicryl and divided.  This maneuver allowed for placement of the testes in the upper scrotum without tension.,A sub dartos pouch was created by separating the abdominal fascia from the scrotal skin after making an incision in the left hemiscrotum in the direction of the vessel.  The testes were then brought into the pouch and anchored with interrupted #4-0 Vicryl sutures.  The skin was approximated with interrupted #5-0 chromic catgut sutures.  Inspection of the spermatic cord in the inguinal area revealed no twisting and the testicular cover was good.  Internal oblique muscle was approximated to the shelving edge and Poupart ligament with interrupted #4-0 Vicryl over the spermatic cord and the external oblique fascia was closed with running #4-0 Vicryl suture.  Additional 7 mL of Marcaine was infiltrated subfascially and the skin was closed with running #5-0 subcuticular after placing several #4-0 Vicryl approximating sutures in the subcutaneous tissues.,Attention was then turned to the opposite side, where an orchiopexy was performed in a similar fashion.  However, on this side, there was no inguinal hernia.  The testes were located in a superficial pouch of the inguinal canal and there was adequate length on the spermatic cord, so that the Prentiss maneuver was not required on this side.  The sub dartos pouch was created in a similar fashion and the wounds were closed similarly as well.,The inguinal and scrotal incisions were cleansed after completion of the procedure.  Steri-Strips and Tegaderm were applied to the inguinal incisions and collodion to the scrotal incision.  The child was then awakened and transported to post-anesthetic recovery area apparently in satisfactory condition.  Instrument and sponge counts were correct.  There were no apparent complications.

Once he was anesthetized, a caudal block was placed.  The patient was placed in supine position and examined.  The left testis well within scrotum.  The right was again not palpable despite the patient being asleep with multiple attempts to check.,The patient was then sterilely prepped and draped.  An 8-French feeding tube was then placed within his bladder through the urethra and attached to the drainage.  We then incised the infraumbilical area once he was sterilely prepped and draped, with 15 blade knife, then using Hasson technique with stay stitches in the anterior and posterior rectus fascia sheath of 3-0 Monocryl.  We entered the peritoneum with the 5-mm one-step system.  We then used the short 0-degree lens for laparoscopy.  We then insufflated with carbon dioxide insufflation to pressure of 12 mmHg.  There was no bleeding noted upon evaluation of the abdomen and again the findings were as mentioned with closed ring with vas and vessels going to the left and vessels and absent vas on the right where the closed ring was found.  Because there was no testis found in the abdomen, we then evacuated the gas and closed the fascial sheath with the 3-0 Monocryl tacking sutures.  Then skin was closed with subcutaneous closure of 4-0 Rapide.  A curvilinear upper scrotal incision was made on the right with 15 blade knife and carried down through the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery.  Electrocautery was used for hemostasis.  A curved tenotomy scissor was used to open the sac.  The tunica vaginalis was visualized and grasped and then dissected up towards external ring.  There was no apparent testicular tissue.  We did remove it, however, tying off the cord structure with a 4-0 Vicryl suture and putting a tagging suture at the base of the tissue sent.  We then closed the subdartos area with the subcutaneous closure of 4-0 chromic.  We then did a similar curvilinear incision on the left side for testicular fixation.  Delivered the testis into the field, which had a type III epididymal attachment and was indeed about 3 to 4 mL in size, which was larger than expected for the patient's age.  We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with the 4-0 chromic pursestring suture and placed testis back into the scrotum in the proper orientation and closed the dartos, skin, and subcutaneous closure with 4-0 chromic on left hemiscrotum.  At the end of the procedure, the patient received IV Toradol and had Dermabond tissue adhesive placed on both incisions and left testis was well descended in the scrotum at the end of the procedure.

79, Orchiopexy & inguinal herniorrhaphy., Urology, Orchiopexy & Herniorrhaphy ,"OPERATIVE NOTE:,  The patient was taken to the operating room and placed in the supine position on the operating room table.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  An incision was made in the groin crease overlying the internal ring.  This incision was about 1.5 cm in length.  The incision was carried down through the Scarpa's layer to the level of the external oblique.  This was opened along the direction of its fibers and carried down along the external spermatic fascia.  The cremasteric fascia was then incised and the internal spermatic fascia was grasped and pulled free.  A hernia sac was identified and the testicle was located.  Next the internal spermatic fascia was incised and the hernia sac was dissected free inside the internal ring.  This was performed by incising the transversalis fascia circumferentially.  The hernia sac was ligated with a 3-0 silk suture high and divided and was noted to retract into the abdominal cavity.  Care was taken not to injure the testicular vessels.  Next the abnormal attachments of the testicle were dissected free distally with care not to injure any long loop vas and these were divided beneath the testicle for a fair distance.  The lateral attachments tethering the cord vessels were freed from the sidewalls in the retroperitoneum high.  This gave excellent length and very adequate length to bring the testicle down into the anterior superior hemiscrotum.  The testicle was viable.  This was wrapped in a moist sponge.,Next a hemostat was passed down through the inguinal canal down into the scrotum.  A small 1 cm incision was made in the anterior superior scrotal wall.  Dissection was carried down through the dartos layer.  A subdartos pouch was formed with blunt dissection.  The hemostat was then pushed against the tissues and this tissue was divided.  The hemostat was then passed through the incision.  A Crile hemostat was passed back up into the inguinal canal.  The distal attachments of the sac were grasped and pulled down without twisting these structures through the incision.  The neck was then closed with a 4-0 Vicryl suture that was not too tight, but tight enough to prevent retraction of the testicle.  The testicle was then tucked down in its proper orientation into the subdartos pouch and the subcuticular tissue was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was closed with a running 6-0 subcuticular chromic suture.  Benzoin and a Steri-Strip were placed.  Next the transversus abdominis arch was reapproximated to the iliopubic tract over the top of the cord vessels to tighten up the ring slightly.  This was done with 2 to 3 interrupted 3-0 silk sutures.  The external oblique was then closed with interrupted 3-0 silk suture.  The Scarpa's layer was closed with a running 4-0 chromic and the skin was then closed with a running 4-0 Vicryl intracuticular stitch.  Benzoin and Steri-Strip were applied.  The testicle was in good position in the dependent portion of the hemiscrotum and the patient had a caudal block, was awakened, and was returned to the recovery room in stable condition.","urology, orchiopexy, benzoin, crile hemostat, scarpa's layer, caudal block, cremasteric fascia, groin crease, hemiscrotum, iliopubic tract, inguinal canal, inguinal herniorrhaphy, intracuticular stitch, retroperitoneum, spermatic fascia, testicle, hernia sac, inguinal, incisionNOTE,: Thesetranscribed medical transcription sample reports and examples are provided by various users andare for reference purpose only.

The patient was given Ancef preop antibiotic.  Ancef irrigation was used throughout the procedure.,BRIEF HISTORY: , The patient is a 63-year-old female who presented to us with urgency and frequency on physical exam.  There was no evidence of cystocele or rectocele.  On urodyanamcis, the patient has significant overactivity of the bladder.  The patient was tried on over three to four different anticholinergic agents such as Detrol, Ditropan, Sanctura, and VESIcare for at least one month each.  The patient had pretty much failure from each of the procedure.  The patient had less than 20% improvement with anticholinergics.  Options such as continuously trying anticholinergics, continuation of the Kegel exercises, and trial of InterStim were discussed.  The patient was interested in the trial.  The patient had percutaneous InterStim trial in the office with over 70% to 80% improvement in her urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence.  The patient was significantly satisfied with the results and wanted to proceed with stage I and II neuromodulator.  Risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, and PE were discussed.  Risk of failure of the procedure in the future was discussed.,Risk of lead migration that the treatment may or may not work in the long-term basis and data on the long term were not clear were discussed with the patient.  The patient understood and wanted to proceed with stage I and II neuromodulator.  Consent was obtained.,DETAILS OF THE OPERATION: , The patient was brought to the OR.  The patient was placed in prone position.  A pillow was placed underneath her pelvis area to slightly lift the pelvis up.  The patient was awake, was given some MAC anesthesia through the IV, but the patient was talking and understanding and was able to verbalize issues.  The patient's back was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Lidocaine 1% was applied on the right side near the S3 foramen.  Under fluoroscopy, the needle placement was confirmed.  The patient felt stimulation in the vaginal area, which was tapping in nature.  The patient also had a pressure feeling in the vaginal area.  The patient had no back sensation or superficial sensation.  There was no sensation down the leg.  The patient did have __________, which turned in slide bellows response indicating the proper positioning of the needle.  A wire was placed.  The tract was dilated and lead was placed.  The patient felt tapping in the vaginal area, which is an indication that the lead is in its proper position.  Most of the leads had very low amplitude and stimulation.  Lead was tunneled under the skin and was brought out through an incision on the left upper buttocks.  Please note that the lidocaine was injected prior to the tunneling.  A pouch was created about 1 cm beneath the subcutaneous tissue over the muscle where the actual unit was connected to the lead.  Screws were turned and they were dropped.  Attention was made to ensure that the lead was all the way in into the InterStim.  Irrigation was performed after placing the main unit in the pouch.  Impedance was checked.

The patient understands the treatment options and wishes to proceed.  He accepts the risks to include bleeding requiring transfusion, infection, sepsis, incontinence, impotence, bladder neck constricture, heart attack, stroke, pulmonary emboli, phlebitis, injury to the bladder, rectum, or ureter, etcetera.,OPERATIVE PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was taken to the Operating Room and placed in the supine position, prepped with Betadine solution and draped in the usual sterile fashion.  A 20- French Foley catheter was inserted into the penis and into the bladder and placed to dependent drainage.  The table was then placed in minimal flexed position.  A midline skin incision was then made from the umbilicus to the symphysis pubis.  It was carried down to the anterior rectus fascia into the pelvis proper.  Both obturator fossae were exposed.  Standard bilateral pelvic lymph node dissections were carried out.  The left side was approached first by myself.  The limits of my dissection were from the external iliac vein laterally to the obturator nerve medially, and from the bifurcation of the common iliac vein proximally to Cooper's ligament distally.  Meticulous lymphostasis and hemostasis was obtained using hemoclips and 2-0 silk ligatures.  The obturator nerve was visualized throughout and was not injured.  The right side was carried out by my assistant under my direct and constant supervision.  Again, the obturator nerve was visualized throughout and it was not injured.  Both packets were sent to Pathology where no evidence of carcinoma was found.,My attention was then directed to the prostate itself.  The  endopelvic fascia was opened bilaterally.  Using gentle dissection with a Kitner, I swept the levator muscles off the prostate and exposed the apical portion of the prostate.  A back bleeding control suture of 0 Vicryl was placed at the mid-prostate level.  A sternal wire was then placed behind the dorsal vein complex which was sharply transected.  The proximal and distal portions of this complex were then oversewn with 2-0 Vicryl in a running fashion.  When I was satisfied that hemostasis was complete, my attention was then turned to the neurovascular bundles.,The urethra was then sharply transected and six sutures of 2-0 Monocryl placed at the 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 o'clock positions.  The prostate was then lifted retrograde in the field and was swept from the anterior surface of the rectum and the posterior layer of Denonvilliers' fascia was incised distally, swept off the rectum and incorporated with the prostate specimen.  The lateral pedicles over the seminal vesicles were then mobilized, hemoclipped and transected.  The seminal vesicles themselves were then mobilized and hemostasis obtained using hemoclips.  Ampullae of the vas were mobilized, hemoclipped and transected.  The bladder neck was then developed using careful blunt and sharp dissection.  The prostate was then transected at the level of the bladder neck and sent for permanent specimen.  The bladder neck was reevaluated and the ureteral orifices were found to be placed well back from the edge.  The bladder neck was reconstructed in standard fashion.  It was closed using a running 2-0 Vicryl.  The mucosa was everted over the edge of the bladder neck using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl suture.  At the end of this portion of the case, the new bladder neck had a stoma-like appearance and would accommodate easily my small finger.  The field was then re-evaluated for hemostasis which was further obtained using hemoclips, Bovie apparatus and 3-0 chromic ligatures.  When I was satisfied that hemostasis was complete, the aforementioned Monocryl sutures were then placed at the corresponding positions in the bladder neck.  A new 20-French Foley catheter was brought in through the urethra into the bladder.  A safety suture of 0 Prolene was brought through the end of this and out through a separate stab wound in the bladder and through the left lateral quadrant.  The table was taken out of flexion and the bladder was then brought into approximation to the urethra and the Monocryl sutures were ligated.  The bladder was then copiously irrigated with sterile water and the anastomosis was found to be watertight.  The pelvis was also copiously irrigated with 2 liters of sterile water.  A 10-French Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the pelvis and brought out through the right lower quadrant and sutured in place with a 2-0 silk ligature.,The wound was then closed in layers.  The muscle was closed with a running 0 chromic, the fascia with a running 1-0 Vicryl, the subcutaneous tissue with 3-0 plain, and the skin with a running 4-0 Vicryl subcuticular.  Steri-Strips were applied and a sterile dressing.,The patient was taken to the Recovery Room in good condition.  There were no complications.  Sponge and instrument counts were reported correct at the end of the case.","urology, mini-laparotomy, radical retropubic prostatectomy, pelvic lymph, pelvic lymph node dissection, cavermap, mini laparotomy, prostatectomy, bladder, intubation, adenocarcinoma, endopelvic, hemostasis, neck","{'Name': 'Unknown', 'Age': 'Unknown', 'Gender': 'Male', 'Symptoms': 'Adenocarcinoma of the prostate', 'Diagnoses': 'Adenocarcinoma of the prostate', 'Medications': 'Unknown', 'Tests': 'Bilateral pelvic lymph node dissections, Pathology, Cavermap'}"

The patient had significant scrotal swelling and pain.  Ultrasound revealed necrotic testicle.  Options such as watchful waiting and removal of the testicle were discussed.  Due to elevated white count, the patient was told that he must have the testicle removed due to the infection and possible early signs of urosepsis.  The risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection, pain, MI, DVT, PE, scrotal issues, other complications were discussed.  The patient was told about the morbidity and mortality of the procedure and wanted to proceed.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL: , The patient was brought to the OR.  Anesthesia was applied.  The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A midline scrotal incision was made.  There was very, very thick scrotal skin.  There was no necrotic skin.  As soon as the left hemiscrotum was entered, significant amount of pus poured out of the left hemiscrotum.  The testicle was completely filled with pus and had completely disintegrated with pus.  The pus just poured out of the left testicle.  The left testicle was completely removed.  Debridement was done of the scrotal wall to remove any necrotic tissue.  Over 2 L of antibiotic irrigation solution was used to irrigate the left hemiscrotum.  There was good tissue left after all the irrigation and debridement.  A Penrose drain was placed in the bottom of the left hemiscrotum.  I worried about the patient may have torsed and then the testicle became necrotic, so the plan was to pex the right testicle, plus the right side also appeared very abnormal.  So, the right hemiscrotum was opened.  The testicle had significant amount of swelling and scrotal wall was very thick.  The testicle appeared normal.  There was no pus coming out of the right hemiscrotum.  At this time, a decision was made to place 4-0 Prolene nonabsorbable stitches in 3 different quadrants to prevent it from torsion.  The hemiscrotum was closed using 2-0 Vicryl in interrupted stitches and the skin was closed using 2-0 PDS in horizontal mattress.  There was very minimal pus left behind and the skin was very healthy.  Decision was made to close it to help the patient heal better in the long run.

The patient did receive Ancef.,INDICATIONS AND CONSENT: , This is a 16-year-old African-American male who had an ectopic left testis that severed approximately one-and-a-half years ago.  The patient did have an MRI, which confirmed ectopic testis located near the pubic tubercle.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the proposed procedure were discussed with the patient.  Informed consent was on the chart at the time of procedure.,PROCEDURE DETAILS:  ,The patient did receive Ancef antibiotics prior to the procedure.  He was then wheeled to the operative suite where a general anesthetic was administered.  He was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and shaved in the area of the intended procedure.  Next, with a #15 blade scalpel, an oblique skin incision was made over the spermatic cord region.  The fascia was then dissected down both bluntly and sharply and hemostasis was maintained with Bovie electrocautery.  The fascia of the external oblique, creating the external ring was then encountered and that was grasped in two areas with hemostats and sized with Metzenbaum scissors.  This was then continued to open the external ring and was then carried cephalad to further open the external ring, exposing the spermatic cord.  With this accomplished, the testis was then identified.  It was located over the left pubic tubercle region and soft tissue was then meticulously dissected and cared to avoid all vascular and testicular structures.,The cord length was then achieved by applying some tension to the testis and further dissecting any of the fascial adhesions along the spermatic cord.  Once again, meticulous care was maintained not to involve any neurovascular or contents of the testis or vas deferens.  Weitlaner retractor was placed to provide further exposure.  There was a small vein encountered posterior to the testis and this was then hemostated into place and cut with Metzenbaum scissors and doubly ligated with #3-0 Vicryl.  Again hemostasis was maintained with ligation and Bovie electrocautery with adequate mobilization of the spermatic cord and testis.  Next, bluntly a tunnel was created through the subcutaneous tissue into the left empty scrotal compartment.  This was taken down to approximately the two-thirds length of the left scrotal compartment.  Once this tunnel has been created, a #15 blade scalpel was then used to make transverse incision.  A skin incision through the scrotal skin and once again the skin edges were grasped with Allis forceps and the dartos was then entered with the Bovie electrocautery exposing the scrotal compartment.  Once this was achieved, the apices of the dartos were then grasped with hemostats and supra-dartos pouch was then created using the Iris scissors.  A dartos pouch was created between the skin and the supra-dartos, both cephalad and caudad to the level of the scrotal incision.  A hemostat was then placed from inferior to superior through the created tunnel and the testis was pulled through the created supra-dartos pouch ensuring that anatomic position was in place, maintaining the epididymis posterolateral without any rotation of the cord.  With this accomplished, #3-0 Prolene was then used to tack both the medial and lateral aspects of the testis to the remaining dartos into the tunica vaginalis.  The sutures were then tied creating the orchiopexy.  The remaining body of the testicle was then tucked into the supra-dartos pouch and the skin was then approximated with #4-0 undyed Monocryl in a horizontal mattress fashion interrupted sutures.  Once again hemostasis was maintained with Bovie electrocautery.  Finally the attention was made towards the inguinal incision and this was then copiously irrigated and any remaining bleeders were then fulgurated with Bovie electrocautery to make sure to avoid any neurovascular spermatic structures.  External ring was then recreated and grasped on each side with hemostats and approximated with #3-0 Vicryl in a running fashion cephalad to caudad.  Once this was created, the created ring was inspected and there was adequate room for the cord.  There appeared to be no evidence of compression.  Finally, subcutaneous layer with sutures of #4-0 interrupted chromic was placed and then the skin was then closed with #4-0 undyed Vicryl in a running subcuticular fashion.  The patient had been injected with bupivacaine prior to closing the skin.  Finally, the patient was cleansed.,The scrotal support was placed and plan will the for the patient to take Keflex one tablet q.i.d. x7 days as well as Tylenol #3 for severe pain and Motrin for moderate pain as well as applying ice packs to scrotum.

The left had atrophic or dysplastic vas and epididymis.,TUBES AND DRAINS: , No tubes or drains were used.,INDICATIONS FOR OPERATION:  ,The patient is a 7-1/2-month-old boy with bilateral nonpalpable testes.  Plan is for exploration, possible orchiopexy.,DESCRIPTION OF OPERATION:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room where surgical consent, operative site, and patient identification were verified.  Once he was anesthetized, he was then palpated and again both testes were nonpalpable.  Because of this, a laparoscopic approach was then elected.  We then sterilely prepped and draped the patient, put an 8-French feeding tube in the urethra, attached to bulb grenade for drainage.  We then made an infraumbilical incision with a 15-blade knife and then further extended with electrocautery and with curved mosquito clamps down to the rectus fascia where we made stay sutures of 3-0 Monocryl on the anterior and posterior sheaths and then opened up the fascia with the curved Metzenbaum scissors.  Once we got into the peritoneum, we placed a 5-mm port with 0-degree short lens.  Insufflation was then done with carbon dioxide up to 10 to 12 mmHg.  We then evaluated.  There was no bleeding noted.  He had a closed ring on the left with a small testis that was evaluated and found to have short vessels as well as atrophic or dysplastic vas, which was barely visualized.  The right side was also intraabdominal, but slightly larger, had better vessels, had much more recognizable vas, and it was closer to the internal ring.  So, we elected to do an orchiopexy on the right side.  Using the laparoscopic 3- and 5-mm dissecting scissors, we then opened up the window at the internal ring through the peritoneal tissue, then dissected it medially and laterally along the line of the vas and along the line of the vessels up towards the kidney, mid way up the abdomen, and across towards the bladder for the vas.  We then used the Maryland dissector to gently tease this tissue once it was incised.  The gubernaculum was then divided with electrocautery and the laparoscopic scissors.  We were able to dissect with the hook dissector in addition to the scissors the peritoneal shunts with the vessels and the vas to the point where we could actually stretch and bring the testis across to the other side, left side of the ring.  We then made a curvilinear incision on the upper aspect of the scrotum on the right with a 15-blade knife and extended down the subcutaneous tissue with electrocautery.  We used the curved tenotomy scissors to make a subdartos pouch.  Using a mosquito clamp, we were able to go in through the previous internal ring opening, grasped the testis, and then pulled it through in a proper orientation.  Using the hook electrode, we were able to dissect some more of the internal ring tissue to relax the vessels and the vas, so there was no much traction.  Using 2 stay sutures of 4-0 chromic, we tacked the testis to the base of scrotum into the middle portion of the testis.  We then closed the upper aspect of the subdartos pouch with a 4-0 chromic and then closed the subdartos pouch and the skin with subcutaneous 4-0 chromic.  We again evaluated the left side and found again that the vessels were quite short.  The testis was more atrophic, and the vas was virtually nonexistent.  We will go back at a later date to try to bring this down, but it will be quite difficult and has a higher risk for atrophy because of the tissue that is present.  We then removed the ports, closed the fascial defects with figure-of-eight suture of 3-0 Monocryl, closed the infraumbilical incision with two Monocryl stay sutures to close the fascial sheath, and then used 4-0 Rapide to close the skin defects, and then using Dermabond tissue adhesives, we covered all incisions.  At the end of the procedure, the right testis was well descended within the scrotum, and the feeding tube was removed.  The patient had IV Toradol and was in stable condition upon transfer to recovery room.","urology, laparoscopic right orchiopexy, undescended testes, orchiopexy, bilateral undescended testes, mosquito clamps, subdartos pouch, internal ring, laparoscopic,","{'Name': 'Unknown', 'Age': '7-1/2-month-old', 'Gender': 'Male', 'Symptoms': 'Bilateral nonpalpable testes', 'Diagnoses': 'Bilateral undescended testes, bilateral intraabdominal testes', 'Medications': 'IV Toradol', 'Tests': 'Examination under anesthesia, laparoscopic exploration'}"

The penis was inspected.  The meatus was inspected and an incision was made in the dorsal portion of the meatus up towards the tip of the penis connecting this with the ventral urethral groove.  This was incised longitudinally and closed transversely with 5-0 chromic catgut sutures.  The meatus was calibrated and accepted the calibrating instrument without difficulty, and there was no stenosis.  An incision was made transversely below the meatus in a circumferential way around the shaft of the penis, bringing up the skin of the penis from the corpora.  The glans was undermined with sharp dissection and hemostasis was obtained with a Bovie.  Using a skin hook, the meatus was elevated ventrally and the glans flaps were reapproximated using 5-0 chromic catgut, creating a new ventral portion of the glans using the flaps of skin.  There was good viability of the skin.  The incision around the base of the penis was performed, separating the foreskin that was going to be removed from the coronal skin.  This was removed and hemostasis was obtained with a Bovie.  0.25% Marcaine was infiltrated at the base of the penis for post-op pain relief, and the coronal and penile skin was reanastomosed using 4-0 chromic catgut.  At the conclusion of the procedure, Vaseline gauze was wrapped around the penis.

The patient presents for laparoscopic pyeloplasty.,PROCEDURE: , After informed consent was obtained, the patient was taken to the operative suite and administered general anesthetic.  The patient was sterilely prepped and draped in the supine fashion after building up the right side of the OR table to aid in the patient's positioning for bowel retraction.  Hassan technique was performed for the initial trocar placement in the periumbilical region.  Abdominal insufflation was performed.  There were significant adhesions noted.  A second 12 mm port was placed in the right midclavicular line at the level of the umbilicus and a Harmonic scalpel was placed through this and adhesiolysis was performed for approximately two-and-half hours, also an additional port was placed 12 mm in the midline between the xiphoid process and the umbilicus, an additional 5 mm port in the right upper quadrant subcostal and midclavicular.  After adhesions were taken down, the ascending colon was mobilized by incising the white line of Toldt and mobilizing this medially.  The kidney was able to be palpated within Gerota's fascia.  The psoas muscle caudate to the inferior pole of the kidney was identified and the tissue overlying this was dissected to the level of the ureter.  The uterus was grasped with a Babcock through a trocar port and carried up to the level of the ureteropelvic junction obstruction.  The renal pelvis was also identified and dissected free.  There was significant fibrosis and scar tissue around the ureteropelvic junction obliterating the tissue planes.  We were unable to dissect through this mass of fibrotic tissue safely and therefore the decision was made to abort the laparoscopic procedure and perform the pyeloplasty open.  An incision was made from the right upper quadrant port extending towards the midline.  This was carried down through the subcutaneous tissue, anterior fascia, muscle layers, posterior fascia, and peritoneum.  A Bookwalter retractor was placed.  The renal pelvis and the ureter were again identified.  Fibrotic tissue was able to be dissected away at this time utilizing right angle clamps and Bovie cautery.  The tissue was sent down to Pathology for analysis.  Please note that upon entering the abdomen, all of the above which was taken down from the adhesions to the abdominal wall were carefully inspected and no evidence of bowel injury was noted.  Ureter was divided just distal to the ureteropelvic junction obstruction and stent was maintained in place.  The renal pelvis was then opened in a longitudinal manner and excessive pelvis was removed reducing the redundant tissue.  At this point, the indwelling double-J ureteral stent was removed.  At this time, the ureter was spatulated laterally and at the apex of this spatulation a #4-0 Vicryl suture was placed.  This was brought up to the deepened portion of the pyelotomy and cystic structures were approximated.  The back wall of the ureteropelvic anastomosis was then approximated with running #4-0 Vicryl suture.  At this point, a double-J stent was placed with a guidewire down into the bladder.  The anterior wall of the uteropelvic anastomosis was then closed again with a #4-0 running Vicryl suture.  Renal sinus fat was then placed around the anastomosis and sutured in place.  Please note in the inferior pole of the kidney, there was approximately 2 cm laceration which was identified during the dissection of the fibrotic tissue.  This was repaired with horizontal mattress sutures #2-0 Vicryl.  FloSeal was placed over this and the renal capsule was placed over this.  A good hemostasis was noted.  A #10 Blake drain was placed through one of the previous trocar sites and placed into the perirenal space away from the anastomosis.  The initial trocar incision was closed with #0 Vicryl suture.  The abdominal incision was also then closed with running #0 Vicryl suture incorporating all layers of muscle and fascia.  The Scarpa's fascia was then closed with interrupted #3-0 Vicryl suture.  The skin edges were then closed with staples.  Please note that all port sites were inspected prior to closing and hemostasis was noted at all sites and the fascia was noted to be reapproximated as these trocar sites were placed with the ________ obturator.

The procedure was discussed with the patient and the patient opted for laparoscopic repair due to multiple attempts at the open inguinal repair on the right.  The patient also is requesting circumcision with phimosis at the same operating time setting.,INTRAOPERATIVE FINDINGS: , The patient was found to have a right inguinal hernia with omentum and bowel within the hernia, which was easily reduced.  The patient was also found to have a phimosis, which was easily removed.,PROCEDURE:,  After informed consent, the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patient.  The patient was brought to operating suite, after general endotracheal intubation, prepped and draped in the normal sterile fashion.  An infraumbilical incision was made with a #15 Bard-Parker scalpel.  The umbilical skin was elevated with a towel clip and the Veress needle was inserted without difficulty.  Saline drop test proved entrance into the abdominal cavity and then the abdomen was insufflated to sufficient pressure of 15 mmHg.  Next, the Veress was removed and #10 bladed trocar was inserted without difficulty.  The 30-degree camera laparoscope was then inserted and the abdomen was explored.  There was evidence of a large right inguinal hernia, which had omentum as well as bowel within it, easily reducible.  Attention was next made to placing a #12 port in the right upper quadrant, four fingerbreadths from the umbilicus.  Again, a skin was made with a #15 blade scalpel and the #12 port was inserted under direct visualization.  A #5 port was inserted in the left upper quadrant in similar fashion without difficulty under direct visualization.  Next, a grasper with blunt dissector was used to reduce the hernia and withdraw the sac and using an Endoshears, the peritoneum was scored towards the midline and towards the medial umbilical ligament and lateral.  The peritoneum was then spread using the blunt dissector, opening up and identifying the iliopubic tract, which was identified without difficulty.  Dissection was carried out, freeing up the hernia sac from the peritoneum.  This was done without difficulty reducing the hernia in its entirety.  Attention was next made to placing a piece of Prolene mesh, it was placed through the #12 port and placed into the desired position, stapled into place in its medial aspect via the 4 mm staples along the iliopubic tract.  The 4.8 mm staples were then used to staple the superior edge of the mesh just below the peritoneum and then the patient was re-peritonealized, re-approximating edge of the perineum with the 4.8 mm staples.  This was done without difficulty.  All three ports were removed under direct visualization.  No evidence of bleeding and the #10 and #12 mm ports were closed with #0-Vicryl and UR6 needle.  Skin was closed with running subcuticular #4-0 undyed Vicryl.  Steri-Strips and sterile dressings were applied.  Attention was next made to carrying out the circumcision.  The foreskin was retracted back over the penis head.  The desired amount of removing foreskin was marked out with a skin marker.  The foreskin was then put on tension using a clamp to protect the penis head.  A #15 blade scalpel was used to remove the foreskin and sending off as specimen.  This was done without difficulty.  Next, the remaining edges were retracted, hemostasis was obtained with Bovie electrocautery and the skin edges were re-approximated with #2-0 plain gut in simple interrupted fashion and circumferentially.  This was done without difficulty maintaining hemostasis.,A petroleum jelly was applied with a Coban dressing.  The patient tolerated this procedure well and was well and was transferred to recovery after extubation in stable condition.","urology, herniorrhaphy with mesh, laparoscopic, blunt dissector, inguinal herniorrhaphy, inguinal hernia, hernia, inguinal, peritoneum, circumcision, phimosis, foreskin","{'Name': 'Not specified', 'Age': '66', 'Gender': 'Male', 'Symptoms': ['Recurrent right inguinal hernia', 'Phimosis'], 'Diagnoses': ['Recurrent right inguinal hernia', 'Phimosis'], 'Medications': [], 'Tests': []}"

The right inguinal region was shaved and prepped and draped in a routine sterile fashion.  The patient received 1 gm of Ancef IV push.,Transverse incision was made in the intraabdominal crease and carried through skin and subcutaneous tissue.  The external oblique fascia was exposed and incised down to and through the external inguinal ring.  The spermatic cord and hernia sac were dissected bluntly off the undersurface of the external oblique fascia exposing the attenuated floor of the inguinal canal.  The cord was surrounded with a Penrose drain.  The hernia sac was separated from the cord structures.  The floor of the inguinal canal, which consisted of attenuated transversalis fascia, was imbricated upon itself with a running locked suture of 2-0 Prolene.  Marlex patch 1 x 4 in dimension was trimmed to an appropriate shape with a defect to accommodate the cord.  It was placed around the cord and sutured to itself with 2-0 Prolene.  The patch was then sutured medially to the pubic tubercle, inferiorly to Cooper's ligament and inguinal ligaments, and superiorly to conjoined tendon using 2-0 Prolene.  The area was irrigated with saline solution, and 0.5% Marcaine with epinephrine was injected to provide prolonged postoperative pain relief.  The cord was returned to its position.  External oblique fascia was closed with a running 2-0 PDS, subcu with 2-0 Vicryl, and skin with running subdermal 4-0 Vicryl and Steri-Strips.  Sponge and needle counts were correct.  Sterile dressing was applied.","urology, marlex repair, inguinal region, external oblique fascia, inguinal ring, direct right inguinal hernia, inguinal hernia, inguinal, repair, marlex, oblique, fascia, hernia, ","{'Name': 'Unknown', 'Age': 'Unknown', 'Gender': 'Unknown', 'Symptoms': 'Right inguinal hernia', 'Diagnoses': 'Direct right inguinal hernia', 'Medications': 'Ancef IV push, Marcaine with epinephrine', 'Tests': 'Unknown'}"
