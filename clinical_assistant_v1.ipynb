    "# 1. Improved Readability:\n",
    "#    - Makes patient notes easier to interpret by organizing them into fields like\n",
    "#      \"Symptoms\", \"Diagnoses\", \"Tests\", etc.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 2. Enhanced Similarity Scoring:\n",
    "#    - Structured fields help improve semantic similarity in embedding space.\n",

    "#      field in JSON, which boosts similarity during vector-based retrieval.\n",

    "# 🎯 Purpose:\n",
    "#     Generate a clinically-relevant response to a doctor's query using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "#     Combines vector similarity search with a large language model for contextualized answers.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 🧩 How it works:\n",
    "#   1. 🔎 Embed the incoming query using Gemini's `text-embedding-004` model.\n",
    "#      - Task type: `RETRIEVAL_QUERY`, ideal for querying over a vector store.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#   2. 📈 Perform vector similarity search using FAISS:\n",
    "#      - Compute the query's embedding.\n",
    "#      - Search `index` for the top_k most similar patient records (based on L2 distance).\n",
    "#\n",
    "#   3. 📚 Construct context:\n",
    "#      - Extract the top similar `rag_text` entries from the dataframe.\n",
    "#      - Join them with separators to serve as knowledge grounding for the LLM.\n",
    "#\n",
    "#   4. 🧾 Compose a prompt:\n",
    "#      - Includes retrieved patient records and the original doctor query.\n",
    "#      - Framed to instruct the model as a clinical assistant.\n",
    "#\n",

      "Based on the limited information provided and the patient records, here's a possible approach:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Possible Diagnoses:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the symptoms of persistent cough, nasal congestion, and occasional wheezing, and drawing parallels from the provided patient records (especially the first patient's profile), the following diagnoses should be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Allergic Rhinitis:** This is a strong possibility, especially if the symptoms are seasonal or triggered by specific allergens. Nasal congestion is a primary symptom, and cough can be related to postnasal drip. Wheezing can occur if the allergic response triggers bronchospasm.\n",
      "*   **Asthma:** The wheezing is a key indicator. Asthma often presents with cough, especially at night or with exercise, and can be exacerbated by allergic rhinitis.\n",
      "*   **Upper Respiratory Infection (URI):** A common cold or other viral URI could cause these symptoms. However, given the \"persistent\" nature of the cough, this is less likely, unless it's a prolonged post-viral cough.\n",
      "*   **Postnasal Drip Syndrome:** Excessive mucus production from the nasal passages dripping down the throat can cause a persistent cough and throat irritation.\n",
      "*   **Gastroesophageal Reflux (GERD):** Although not immediately suggested by the nasal congestion, chronic cough can be a symptom of GERD, especially if it occurs at night.\n",
      "*   **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):** More likely in older patients with a history of smoking or exposure to pollutants. The cough and wheezing could be indicative of COPD.\n",
      "*   **Bronchitis:** Inflammation of the bronchial tubes can cause a persistent cough, often with mucus production.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggested Medications (Disclaimer: This is for informational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice. A proper examination and diagnosis are required before prescribing any medication):**\n",
      "\n",
      "The choice of medication depends heavily on the confirmed diagnosis. Here are some possibilities based on the likely diagnoses above:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **For Allergic Rhinitis:**\n",
      "    *   **Antihistamines:**\n",
      "        *   **Oral:** Options include loratadine (Claritin), cetirizine (Zyrtec), fexofenadine (Allegra). The patient in the records has previously used Claritin, Zyrtec, and Allegra.\n",
      "        *   **Nasal:** Azelastine (Astelin, Astepro)\n",
      "    *   **Nasal Corticosteroids:** Fluticasone propionate (Flonase), mometasone furoate (Nasonex) - The first patient was given Nasonex sample. These are effective for reducing nasal inflammation and congestion.\n",
      "    *   **Decongestants:** Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) or phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine) can help with nasal congestion, but should be used with caution due to potential side effects (increased blood pressure, insomnia) and are not for long-term use.\n",
      "    *   **Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists:** Montelukast (Singulair) can be helpful, especially if asthma is also present.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **For Asthma:**\n",
      "    *   **Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS):** Budesonide (Pulmicort), fluticasone (Flovent) - These reduce airway inflammation.\n",
      "    *   **Long-Acting Beta-Agonists (LABA):** Salmeterol (Serevent), formoterol (Foradil) - These help to open the airways and are typically used in combination with an ICS.\n",
      "    *   **Short-Acting Beta-Agonists (SABA):** Albuterol (Ventolin, ProAir) - For quick relief of wheezing and shortness of breath.\n",
      "    *   **Combination ICS/LABA Inhalers:** Advair (fluticasone/salmeterol), Symbicort (budesonide/formoterol)\n",
      "    *   **Leukotriene Receptor Antagonists:** Montelukast (Singulair) can be used as add-on therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **For URI (if suspected):**\n",
      "    *   **Decongestants:** As above.\n",
      "    *   **Pain relievers:** Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) for fever and body aches.\n",
      "    *   **Cough suppressants:** Dextromethorphan (Robitussin DM) or guaifenesin (Mucinex) may provide some relief, but their effectiveness is debated.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **For Postnasal Drip:**\n",
      "    *   **Saline nasal sprays:** To help thin mucus.\n",
      "    *   **Guaifenesin (Mucinex):** To help loosen mucus.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **For GERD (if suspected):**\n",
      "    *   **Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs):** Omeprazole (Prilosec), lansoprazole (Prevacid)\n",
      "    *   **H2 Receptor Antagonists:** Famotidine (Pepcid)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Detailed History:** A thorough medical history is crucial. This includes:\n",
      "    *   Onset and duration of symptoms\n",
      "    *   Triggers (allergens, exercise, cold air, etc.)\n",
      "    *   Smoking history\n",
      "    *   Family history of allergies or asthma\n",
      "    *   Occupational exposures\n",
      "*   **Physical Exam:** A comprehensive physical exam, including lung auscultation, nasal examination, and throat examination, is necessary.\n",
      "*   **Further Testing:** Depending on the initial assessment, further testing may be needed:\n",
      "    *   **Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs):** To assess lung function and diagnose asthma or COPD.\n",
      "    *   **Allergy Testing:** Skin prick tests or blood tests (RAST) to identify specific allergens.\n",
      "    *   **Chest X-ray:** To rule out other lung conditions.\n",
      "    *   **Sputum Culture:** If infection is suspected.\n",
      "\n",

However, a thorough evaluation, including a detailed history, physical exam, and potentially further testing, is essential to establish the correct diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan.

      "\n",
      "**Treatment Suggestions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Pain Assessment:** A thorough pain assessment is crucial. This includes determining the location, intensity (using a pain scale), quality (e.g., sharp, dull, throbbing), onset, duration, aggravating factors, and relieving factors.\n",
      "*   **Non-Pharmacological Interventions:** Depending on the suspected cause, consider:\n",
      "    *   Rest\n",
      "    *   Ice or heat application\n",
      "    *   Elevation\n",
      "    *   Compression\n",
      "    *   Physical therapy\n",
      "*   **Pharmacological Interventions:**\n",
      "    *   **Over-the-counter analgesics:** Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) may be appropriate for mild to moderate pain.\n",
      "    *   **Prescription analgesics:** Opioids (e.g., codeine, morphine) should be reserved for severe pain and used with caution due to the risk of dependence and other side effects.  Non-opioid options such as tramadol or tapentadol may also be considered.\n",
      "    *   **Adjuvant medications:**  Depending on the suspected underlying cause of the pain, medications like muscle relaxants, neuropathic pain agents (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin), or corticosteroids may be appropriate.\n",
      "*   **Interventional Pain Management:**  In some cases, nerve blocks, epidural injections, or other interventional procedures might be considered for pain relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Next Steps:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Detailed History and Physical Exam:** Obtain a comprehensive medical history, including past medical conditions, medications, allergies, and a detailed description of the pain. Perform a thorough physical examination, focusing on the area of pain.\n",
      "2.  **Diagnostic Testing:** Order appropriate diagnostic tests based on the suspected cause of the pain. These may include:\n",
      "    *   **Imaging studies:** X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, ultrasound.\n",
      "    *   **Blood tests:** Complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, inflammatory markers.\n",
      "    *   **Urine tests:** Urinalysis.\n",
      "    *   **Nerve conduction studies:** If nerve involvement is suspected.\n",
      "3.  **Referral:**  If the diagnosis is unclear or the pain is severe or unresponsive to initial treatment, consider referral to a specialist (e.g., pain management specialist, neurologist, orthopedist).\n",

      "\n",
      "**Common Recommended Tests for Acute Pain (Organized by Potential Area of Concern)**\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the broad initial symptom of \"acute pain,\" a tiered approach is often used, starting with more general tests and progressing to more specific ones based on initial findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "**I. General Tests (Often Initial Investigations):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):**\n",
      "    *   **Purpose:** Detects infection (elevated white blood cell count), anemia (low red blood cell count), or clotting problems (platelet abnormalities).  Can help rule out systemic inflammatory processes.\n",
      "    *   **Why:** Useful in nearly all cases to look for signs of infection, inflammation, or blood disorders.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Electrolyte Panel (CMP or BMP):**\n",
      "    *   **Purpose:** Evaluates kidney function, electrolyte balance (sodium, potassium, calcium), and liver function.\n",
      "    *   **Why:** Electrolyte imbalances can contribute to muscle cramps or pain. Kidney problems can cause flank pain. Liver problems can cause abdominal pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Urinalysis (UA):**\n",
      "    *   **Purpose:** Detects urinary tract infection (UTI), kidney stones, or blood in the urine.\n",
      "    *   **Why:** UTIs and kidney stones are common causes of acute pain, particularly in the flank or lower abdomen.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Inflammatory Markers (CRP or ESR):**\n",
      "     *   **Purpose:** Detects general inflammation in the body.\n",
      "     *   **Why:** Helps rule out general inflammatory conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**II. Musculoskeletal Pain:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **X-rays:**\n",
      "    *   **Purpose:** Detects fractures, dislocations, arthritis, and other bone abnormalities.\n",
      "    *   **Why:** First-line imaging for suspected bone injuries or joint problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging):**\n",
      "    *   **Purpose:** Provides detailed images of soft tissues, including muscles, ligaments, tendons, cartilage, and nerves. Detects tears, sprains, nerve impingement, disc herniations, and soft tissue masses.\n",
      "    *   **Why:** Used when X-rays are normal or inconclusive, or when soft tissue injury is suspected.  Especially helpful for spine-related pain or joint pain.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **CT Scan (Computed Tomography):**\n",
      "    *   **Purpose:** Provides detailed cross-sectional images of bones and soft tissues. Good for detecting fractures, dislocations, and some soft tissue injuries.\n",
      "    *   **Why:** Can be used as an alternative to MRI in some cases, especially when MRI is contraindicated (e.g., patient with a pacemaker) or unavailable.  Faster than MRI and good for bony detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Ultrasound:**\n",
      "    *   **Purpose:** Imaging for tendons, ligaments, muscles, and joints. Can assess for fluid collections or tears.\n",
      "    *   **Why:** Often used for evaluating superficial soft tissue injuries, such as tendon tears (e.g., rotator cuff), especially if MRI is not readily available.\n",
      "\n",
      "**III. Neurological Pain:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS) and Electromyography (EMG):**\n",
      "    *   **Purpose:** Evaluates the function of peripheral nerves and muscles. Detects nerve damage, nerve compression (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome), or muscle disorders.\n",
      "    *   **Why:** Used when nerve involvement is suspected, such as in cases of radiculopathy (nerve root compression), peripheral neuropathy, or muscle weakness.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **MRI (Brain or Spine):**\n",
      "    *   **Purpose:** Detects structural abnormalities in the brain or spinal cord, such as tumors, lesions, or nerve compression.\n",
      "    *   **Why:** Used when central nervous system involvement is suspected, such as in cases of severe headaches, unexplained neurological symptoms, or spinal cord compression.\n",
      "\n",
      "**IV. Gastrointestinal Pain:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Abdominal CT Scan:**\n",
      "    *   **Purpose:** Detects appendicitis, bowel obstruction, diverticulitis, pancreatitis, or other abdominal abnormalities.\n",
      "    *   **Why:** Used for severe abdominal pain or when other tests are inconclusive.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Abdominal Ultrasound:**\n",
      "    *   **Purpose:** Evaluates the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and other abdominal organs.  Can detect gallstones, liver masses, or fluid collections.\n",
      "    *   **Why:** Often used as a first-line imaging test for abdominal pain, especially in pregnant women and children.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Endoscopy/Colonoscopy:**\n",

      "    *   **Why:** Used for persistent or severe abdominal pain, bleeding, or changes in bowel habits.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Amylase and Lipase:**\n",
      "    *   **Purpose:** Blood tests to detect pancreatitis.\n",
      "    *   **Why:** Evaluates for pancreatitis when upper abdominal pain is present.\n",
      "\n",
      "**V. Cardiovascular Pain:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG):**\n",
      "    *   **Purpose:** Records the electrical activity of the heart. Detects arrhythmias, ischemia (reduced blood flow to the heart), or heart attack.\n",
      "    *   **Why:** Essential for chest pain, especially if associated with shortness of breath, dizziness, or nausea.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Cardiac Enzymes (Troponin):**\n",
      "    *   **Purpose:** Blood test to detect heart muscle damage.\n",
      "    *   **Why:** Used to diagnose a heart attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Echocardiogram:**\n",
      "    *   **Purpose:** Ultrasound of the heart to assess heart function, valve abnormalities, and other cardiac problems.\n",
      "    *   **Why:** Used if there is suspicion of underlying heart disease.\n",

      "       *   **Purpose:** Detects blockages in major blood vessels.\n",
      "       *   **Why:** Checks for blood clots or aneurysm.\n",
      "\n",
      "**VI. Renal Pain:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **CT Scan (without contrast):**\n",
      "    *   **Purpose:** Detects kidney stones.\n",
      "    *   **Why:** The gold standard for diagnosing kidney stones.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Important Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clinical Judgement:** The choice of tests depends on the clinical presentation, including the patient's history, physical exam findings, and risk factors.\n",
      "*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Consider the cost of each test and its potential yield. Start with less expensive and less invasive tests first, if appropriate.\n",
      "*   **Radiation Exposure:** Minimize radiation exposure, especially in children and pregnant women. Ultrasound and MRI are radiation-free imaging modalities.\n",
      "*   **Contrast Allergies and Renal Function:** If contrast-enhanced imaging (CT or MRI) is needed, assess for contrast allergies and renal function before administering contrast.\n",
      "*   **Patient Factors:** Patient's age, overall health, and ability to tolerate certain tests need to be taken into consideration.\n",
      "*   **Timeliness:** In cases of severe pain, time is of the essence. Prioritize tests that can provide rapid and accurate diagnoses.\n",
